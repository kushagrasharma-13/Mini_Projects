So, this\\nlecture will be structured into various parts: first we will be looking at patent law as a\\nsystem of concepts, then we will be looking at ways to understand the Patents Act, and\\nlater on we will be looking at the legislations that comprise patent law which are the act\\nrules and the manual. So, first we look at patent law as concepts.\\nPatent law comprises of different concepts; different legal concepts and together they\\nform the branch of law called intellectual property rights. But before we understand\\npatents we need to understand what intellectual property rights are.\\n(Refer Slide Time: 01:24)\\n 1  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 4}), Document(page_content='An IPR or intellectual property right is a set of rights that come out of the creations of\\nmind. For instance, inventions are protected by means of patents, literary and artistic\\nworks a protected by the copyright regime and names that we often use in trade and\\nbusiness are protected by the trade mark regime. An intellectual property right offers\\nexclusive monopoly right to the owner of the right, normally manifest on intangible\\nproperty and in that way, they differ from real property.\\n(Refer Slide Time: 02:02)\\nIntellectual property rights as I said it is not branch of law, it is a conglomeration of\\ndifferent areas of law. Patent law is itself a different branch of law copyright law is\\ndifferent from patent law, in the sense that the modes of establishing the right creation of\\nthe right and the enforcement of the right are much  different in patent law  and in\\ncopyright law.\\nFor instance, in patent law to prove infringement you will have to look at the document\\nthat encompasses the patent right which is what we call a patent specification. Then look\\nat the infringing act which could be an act done by the infringer and map the act into the\\nscope of the right that is covered in the patent specification. This is how infringement is\\nproved. So, the process of proving infringement is comparing an act committed by the\\ninteger to the scope of right that is carved out in a particular document. Whereas if we\\n 2  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 5}), Document(page_content='look at copyright or even for that matter trademarks the rights that are manifested in the\\ntrademark or the copyright are proved by a normal comparison of the infringing right.\\nFor instance, if there is a book that is copyrighted and there is also another work which is\\nallegedly influencing the copyright then all you need to do is a read through the two\\nbooks and see whether there is a likelihood of the one work being a copy of the other. So,\\ninfringement is proved by a simple mechanism of reading or comparing two documents.\\nSimilarly, for trademarks, the infringement is proved by looking at the two similar marks\\nand the standard is one of reasonableness. So, if it is reasonably found that one mark\\ncould not have been made without looking at the other mark there is an initial case of\\ninfringement.\\nSo, even the ways in which infringement is proved are different when it comes to the\\ndifferent kinds of intellectual property rights. Then what is it that holds these intellectual\\nproperty rights together? Why are they formed or regarded as a group of rights that are\\nthought and learnt and studied together?\\n(Refer Slide Time: 04:18)\\nSo, we can come across various explanations. One of the predominant explanations\\nwhich is a classical one is that these rights where came out of some form of creative\\n 3  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 6}), Document(page_content='labour. Now creative labour is something which we understand as being different from\\nphysical labour. So, creative labour when it resulted in certain rights those rights could\\nbe captured by these regimes. So, if the creative labour was a result of a person or a\\ngroup of people coming up with an invention in a technological domain then that right in\\nthe invention came to be captured by patents.\\nIf the right patent to an artistic or a literary work which was largely expressed in some\\nmedium then that right could be captured by a copyright. If the work, the creative work\\npatent to a mark or a logo which ascertain the origin of the goods and services then you\\nhad trademark which came into as a right by which you could understand the origin of\\ngoods and services.\\nNow, these rights do have a creative or an intellectual element and that is largely the\\nreason why they are called intellectual property rights. They also confer exclusivity to\\nthe right holder. So, the common trade for all intellectual property rights, they confer\\nexclusivity to the right holder. And exclusivity means they have right to exclude others\\nfrom using the right. So, if you have a patent if the patent is granted by the patent in\\nIndia it is granted by the intellectual property office, then you have an exclusive right to\\nuse the invention for a period of 20 years from the date of application.\\nNow this is actually not an exclusive right to use, it is actually a right to exclude others\\nfrom using. It also includes a set of rights for an instance you can exclude others from\\nmanufacturing,  excludes  others  from  selling,  exclude  others  from  offering  for  sale,\\nexclude others from licensing, transferring, and the whole set of rights are involved here.\\nSo, the grant of a patent in itself confers an exclusivity. Similarly, a copyright and a\\ntrademark also confer exclusivity.\\nNow  these  rights  are  different  from  the  rights  that  western  real  property,  because\\nintellectual property one way we can understand intellectual property is by distinguishing\\nthem with real property. Real property has borders and it is tangible; you could ascertain\\nthe limits of the real property in time and space its possible for you to if the real property\\nis a land you  could go to the site and ascertain the boundaries of the property. To\\nascertain the boundaries of a patent right it is not immediately discernible by looking at\\n 4  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 7}), Document(page_content='the  product  in  which  the  patent  manifest.  The  product  may  have  a  notification\\nsomewhere say that it is covered by a patent showing a number.\\nBut you would not know; what is the extent of the right covered in the patent; unless you\\nlook at an external document. In this case the patent specification or the granted patent.\\nSo, the right that manifests in the patent is actually a created right, it is not apparent, it is\\nnot open in a sense that a person can see the technology and understand that it is\\npatented. It is created because the right was carved out by a legal mechanism where the\\nlaw offers such rights to be carved out. And right is protected by documentation; by\\ndocumentation be referred to a process of registration by which the right is recognised.\\nThere are certain right which does not require any registration. For instance, the right of\\na parent over a child that comes out of a relationship between the parent and the child\\nwhich  the world recognises  by the fact  that  the child  and  the parent  live  together,\\nwhereas other rights are created; for instance, a patent right is created it is carved by\\ndistinguishing the invention from what had gone before.\\n(Refer Slide Time: 08:33)\\nSo, in the case of patent rights you need to go through a process of registration. And the\\nprocess of registration starts with a person filing a patent application before the patent\\n 5  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 8}), Document(page_content='office, and the patent office scrutinizing the application for certain checks, and later on\\nthe patent granting this application into a granted patent. This process the application\\ngoes from a formal application and it materializes into a grant is what we call patent\\nprosecution.\\nOnce the patent is granted then the enforcement of a patent which refers to steps taken by\\nthe patent holder to ensure that the patent is not violated; the right in the patent is not\\nviolated by others which is what we refer to as infringement. The enforcement part\\nhappens before the courts. So, the patent offers or the intellectual property office; the\\ntask of the intellectual property office is to scrutinize the patent application and grant of\\npatent where as the courts or a judicial system is interested with the task of enforcing\\nthem. So, if there is an infringement of a patent the patent holder will have to file an\\ninfringement suit before the courts.\\n(Refer Slide Time: 09:51)\\nNow, in a modern environment, in which we live there is need to protect intellectual\\nproperty. The need to protect intellectual property arises from the fact that we are now\\nliving in a knowledge economy. And the knowledge economy is distinguished by who\\nhas access to knowledge not only who has access knowledge, but also who is able to use\\nthis knowledge to his or her benefit.\\n 6  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 9}), Document(page_content='Intellectual property actually gives exclusive the over use of knowledge and information\\nin one form or the other.

So, if you look at the history of patent law that is from the international legal\\nsystem we can find that patent law like other intellectual property regimes are actually\\npushed down by a group of countries to other countries; in the sense that, the norms are\\nmade at the international level and then they are replicated or they are adopted at the\\ndomestic level.\\nSo, which is true for India the Indian IP regime started off as British act the Patents Act\\nof 1911 which was brought into India when the Britisher’s were ruling the country.\\n(Refer Slide Time: 11:31)\\nFundamentals  of  patents:  patents  offer  an  exclusive  monopoly  right;  this  right  is\\nconferred  by  the  government  and  it  is  for  a  period  of  20  years  from  the  date  of\\napplication.

So, an Indian patent can only be enforced within the boundaries of India.\\n(Refer Slide Time: 12:36)\\nThey are granted for a period of 20 years. Patent serve different purposes. Now the\\nobject of a patent or the grant of a patent could be to identify area and technology and to\\ndo further work. So, finding a patent gives the patentee or the patent owner the right to\\nwork on a particular sphere to the exclusion of others. So, whatever products that can\\ncome out of that technological area can now be carved as a right by the patent holder.\\nPatents are also seen as instruments that can incentivize innovation. By offering limited\\nmonopoly for the inventor the patent system actually incentivises people to take risky\\ntasks like spending time effort and money in developing inventions.

But soon after independence it was felt that\\nbecause patents are tied closely to the development of a nation it was felt that India\\nrequired its own patent law.\\nSo,  post  independence  there  were  two  committees  led  by  experts:  the  Tek  Chand\\nCommittee  and  Ayyangar  Committee  which  were  established  to  study  whether  the\\nexisting patent regime which was in 1911 Act suited the national interest and move\\n 9  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 12}), Document(page_content='particularly at the stage in which India was a newly independent country and trying to\\nmake its place firm in the global economy. And it was found by both the committees that\\nthe Patents Act as it existed does not favour local and national development.\\nSo,  there  was  a  proposal  by  the  Tek  Chand  Committee  followed  by the  Ayyangar\\nCommittee to revise the patent laws. And the 1970 Act which is the present act that we\\nhave came as an exercise that was suggested by taking all the measures the committees\\nhad suggested. So, the 1970 Act for the first time it removed product protection for\\nmedicines. Earlier the 1911 Act had offered product protection for product patents; what\\nwe call product patents for pharmaceutical and drugs; pharmaceuticals and drugs. Now\\nthis was removed by the 1970 Act.\\nThe 1970 Act also made some substantial change changes in on the term of the patent.\\nThe term of a patent was 14 years, and the term of a patent for a food medicine or drug\\nwas a shorter period it would vary between 5 to 7 years. And they were also host of\\nprovisions on compulsory licensing which was introduced by the 1970 Act. The 1970 Act\\nwas after India became member of the world trade organisation in 1995; the act came to\\nbe amended three times in 1999, in 2002 and in 2005.\\nThese were all amendments that brought the act in compliance with the trips agreement\\nof the WTO. The trips agreement being an international agreement it brought a common\\nstandard on various things. For instance, the trips agreement brought in and the trips\\nagreement was actually a product of close to 8 years of negotiations between the member\\ncountries. It brought a common standard that the term of a patent shall be 20 years from\\nthe date of application. India earlier had a 14-year period for inventions in general and a\\nshorter period for patents inventions pertaining to food, drug and medicine.\\nNow this had to be changed. So, apart from this the fact that the Indian patent regime did\\nnot grant product patents for drugs and pharmaceutical was also to be done away with.\\nSo, the Indian patent system went through a series of amendments to the Patents Act in\\n99 followed in 2002 and later on in 2005; these three sets of amendment brought the\\nIndian law in complete compliance with the TRIPS obligations.\\n 10  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 13}), Document(page_content='Soon after amending the act the rules were also amended.

The\\ntimeline can be defined or described in the form of a diagram, the starting point of the\\ntimeline is what we referred to as T A that is the time of application of a patent and the\\nend point of the timeline can be explained as at the time of expiry of the patent.\\nSo, the life of a patent is actually between these 2 points it is between T A and T E, on an\\nideal case when a patent is granted it can survive the patent has a 20-year term.

So, from the\\nday you apply the patent that is from T A up until T G that is the time for the grant you\\nhave roughly and this is not a set on stone it varies from application to application and it\\ncould also be it could vary from patent office to patent office.

So, this time period\\ntakes roughly 3 to 6 years and the sections in the patents act that govern this stage that is\\nfrom T A to T G a largely sections 1 to section 81. So, when we refer to the events that\\nhappened  between  T A and  T G we are  also  looking  at  certain  events  that  happened\\nimmediately upon the grant upon T G. So, it is not just the time for the grant, but also\\ncertain events that can happen immediately upon the grant or soon after the grant.\\nSo, if you need to draw a line demarcating the patent officer’s functions then it will be\\naround section 81. So, anything before section 81 that is section 1 to section 81 are\\nevents that happened at the patent office, up until the grant or soon after the grant.\\n(Refer Slide Time: 03:46)\\nFrom T G to T E that is soon after the patent is granted by the patent office the patent have\\nhas its remaining life and this time period is what we call the time in which a patent is\\nenforced patent enforcement happens between T G and T E.\\nNow, when we say patent enforcement we are referring to X, the patentee, the right\\nholder the patent holder exercising his right in the patent now that could come in the way\\nof licences when a patent is granted the patentee has the right to licence his technology,\\nlicence his invention it also pertains to measures that a patentee can take to prevent\\n 14  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 17}), Document(page_content='others from interfering with his right.

So, it is a right to exclude actually. \\nHe has an exclusive right to exclude others from making the invention from selling the\\ninvention from offering for sale from importing and for using the invention now the\\ninvention can be a product or a process these details are mentioned in section 48, but\\nlargely any intrusion on these sets of rights by a third party without the consent of the\\npatentee is what we refer to as infringement. So, infringement and licensing a licensing is\\na positive act where the patentee allows his invention to be used by others in most cases\\nfor a royalty and enforce and infringement  action  which is  an action taken  by the\\npatentee to stop persons who do not have his consent from using his invention.\\nThese 2 acts can together be called patent enforcement the way in which a patent is\\nenforced soon after the time for grant there is a proceeding that can take place in the\\npatent office which is called a post grant opposition or opposition after the grant the\\nlanguage used in the patents  act is opposition after the grant, but it is in common\\nparlance it is also called post grant opposition though post grant opposition happen\\nimmediately after T G that is one year after TG  that is a timeline for the post grant the\\nprovisions of post grant are mentioned in section 25(1).

So, this is left to the central government to decide when certain provisions of the\\nact can take effect.\\n(Refer Slide Time: 04:18)\\nNow, after the title exempt and commencement you have what we call definition clause\\nnow  definition  and  interpretation  is  a  clause  which  defines  and  gives  a  particular\\nmeaning to words and phrases mentioned in the act. Now, what happens if certain words\\nand phrases are not given a definition under the definition and interpretation clause?\\nNow most acts will have a definition and interpretation clause which will have a list of\\nwords which are defined to give a particular meaning. Now this particular meaning can\\nbe defined in the act if it is not defined elsewhere it can be defined in the definition\\n 34  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 37}), Document(page_content='clause itself we will see instances where the definition can be contained in the definition\\nclause the definition can also appear in another part of the act not in the definition clause\\nin another part of the act, but the definition clause will say have a cross reference to it.\\nThe definition can also refer to a definition of that particular concept or that particular\\nword to another enactment. So, you have different types of definitions one the definition\\nclause defines the definition in the definition clause itself, the definition clause has a\\ncross reference to another part of the act where that word or phrase is defined and\\ndefinition clause could refer to another enactment all together another enactment passed\\nby the central government where this was previously defined.

So, on the right-\\nhand side in bold font you find the cross references. So, if you find a particular portion of\\nthe act what we have mentioned in bold font on the right-hand column is the cross\\nreferences. So, you will know where the capable of industrial application where this\\nphrase is used the phrase is used in section 2 1 j. Now “capable of industrial application\\nin relation to an invention means that the invention is capable of being made or used in\\nan industry”. So, it just tells you what industrial application is.\\nNow, these are all instances of an internal definition where the definition is given in the\\ndefinitional clause that is section 2 in this case now let us look at instances where a\\nphrase or a word is defined, but not in the definitional clause. But by way of a cross\\nreference to another part of the act take appellate board for instance now that is category\\nnumber to the category number one is something that is defined in the definitional clause\\nlike assignee a special definition is given category number 2 is something is defined not\\nin the definitional clause, but by way of a cross reference to a provision to another part of\\nthe patents act itself.\\nAppellate board “appellate board means appellate board referred to in section 116”.

Convention country again there\\nis cross reference to another part of the act in this case it is section 133. Now this is the\\nsecond category it is defined within the act, but not in section 2 or it is not defined in the\\ndefinitional clause and a cross reference is given to where you can find the definition.\\nThe third category is it is defined in another legislation it is defined in another act for\\ninstance  controller;  controller  means  the  controller  general  of  patent  designs  and\\ntrademarks it is a common controller who manages all these portfolios referred to in\\nsection 73. Now the 73 you  will find that is an internal  reference the reference to\\nsomething outside the act will be district court it is a correction it should be district court\\nnot controller; controller again makes an internal reference district court means the mail\\nhas the meaning assigned to that expression by the code of civil procedure CPC 1908.\\nSo, here is a reference to an outside act and act other than the patents act. So, this is a\\nthird category something is defined by reference to another enactment. So, district courts\\nto understand what a district court means you have to look at the code of civil procedure.\\nNow, this is the third category the forth category is actually things which are understood\\n 38  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 41}), Document(page_content='well  which  do  not  require  a  special  definition  I  mentioned  the  union  of  India  is\\nunderstood well.

So, we needed definition because people may not understand what an applet board\\nis. Assignee is used in a special context. So, we need that definition. \\nSo, normally every definition mentioned in the patents act would have been used those\\nwords or those phrases or combination of words would have been used in some part of\\nthe act.

So, that is an exceptional thing, but I\\njust thought I should bring it to you noticed that the new invention which defines the\\nconcept of novelty or the words new inventions are not used anywhere in the act though\\nthey are defined.

As we already mentioned the patent\\namendment rules 2016 was the latest amendment to the rules that came into force. Earlier\\nto  that  the  pattern  rules  2003  was  amended  many  number  of  times  and  all  these\\namendments,  we  are  already  mentioned  makes  it  easy  for  the  law  to  be  changed\\nwherever there is a requirement. We find that the 2016 amendment rules introduced\\nmany new things into the patent rules we will find that for the first time we have the\\ndefinition of start-ups mentioned in rule 2.\\n 48  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 51}), Document(page_content='(Refer Slide Time: 01:02)\\nRule 2 definition rule 2(f)(b) defines a start-up as an entity that has existence of less than\\n5 years from incorporation.\\nNow, we use the word incorporation we understand that the entity could either be an\\nprivate limited company under the companies act or a registered firm registered under\\nsection 59 of the partnership act or under the limited liability partnership act 2002. Now,\\nthis gives the start-up the status of a entity. So, individuals are excluded we get this from\\nthe explanation 2 to the definition individuals are excluded and similarly any kind of\\nassociation of people which cannot come under these 3 categories will also be excluded.\\nSo, to claim a start-up you need to be an incorporated entity something which came into\\nbeing by the force of law it could be a company it could be a partnership firm or it could\\nbe a LLP; a limited liability partnership.\\nSo, incorporation is important and you will find from the definition that the status of a\\nstart-up can exist only for 5 years. So, it is time bound and the 5 years start from the date\\nof incorporation that is the first requirement the second requirement the turnover in the\\nlast 5 years should be less than 25 crores; 25 crores of rupees. So, the turnover of that\\nentity in the last 5 years should be less than 25 crores if it exceeds 25 crores then it\\nceases to be a start-up. \\n 49  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 52}), Document(page_content='The  third  requirement  is  that  the  start-up  should  be  working  towards  innovation\\ndevelopment and commercialization of new products or processes. So, it is a requirement\\nthat it is working towards innovation, development, deployment or commercialization of\\nnew products processes or services driven by technology or intellectual property. So, that\\nis a part of the third requirement that a start-up should be driven by technology or\\nintellectual property.\\nSo, if the entity is not doing anything pertaining to technology or intellectual property\\nthen it may not be able to avail the status of a start-up. Now we will soon tell you how to\\navail the status, but this definition and the concept of a start-up was introduced by the\\n2016 amendment act. The definition also tells us what will not qualify as a start-up for\\ninstance if the product and services do not have the potential of commercialization then\\nthat is not something which will be factored into the status of a start-up if the products\\nare undifferentiated products and our services of processes they are undifferentiated is\\nnothing unique about them it is what everybody else does then again you will not get the\\nstatus of a start-up for the purposes of the patents act and the product and processes with\\nno or limited incremental value for customers of workflow would not be covered under\\nthis definition. So, the value that the company produces is either there is no value or\\nlimited incremental value for the customers or for the workflow.\\nSo, these are the instances. So, a start-up status under the patents act is different from a\\nnormal start-up status for you to be a start-up under the patents act you need to be\\nconcentrating  on  sectors  pertaining  to  technology  or  intellectual  property. So,  your\\nproducts or services or processes should be driven by technology or by intellectual\\nproperty. So, this differs where as a start-up could also be for a social cause a start-up\\ncould be for anything, but under the patents act the definition gives a clear meaning and\\nit  categorises  start-ups  as  being  driven by technology or intellectual  property. Now\\nexplanation one tells us when the status of a start-up will cease now it goes beyond 5\\nyears as I already mentioned the status of a start-up will no longer be there and if the\\nturnover in any of the previous year exceeds 25 crores then again it will not be entitled\\nfor a start-up status.\\nIf you saw that it should be less than 5 years from the date of incorporation which means\\n 50  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 53}), Document(page_content='the entity came into being by a legal process of incorporating a company registering a\\npartnership  firm  or  registering  a  limited  liability  partnership.  Now  incorporation  is\\nimportant because the definition also tells us that you cannot form an entity by splitting\\nup or reconstructing an existing business. So, if there is an existing business you cannot\\nreconstruct it re incorporate it in a new name and call it a start up and you cannot split up\\nan existing big business for instance a big multinational company cannot now de merge\\nor create a smaller entity and say that this is a start-up we should avail all the privileges\\nof a start-up that cannot happen.\\nThen the term turnover we said the turnover should be less than 25 crores it takes the\\nmeaning of the same word turnover under the companies act. So, this is a cross reference\\nto the company’s act 2013 for understanding what turn over means and there is also some\\nreference rates of foreign currency will be asked played by the reserve bank of India. So,\\nif a foreign entity is claiming a start-up status. So, the similar test will be applied for the\\nforeign entity. So, if you want to know turner if the sales are abroad. So, you could use\\nthe same rates as stipulated by the reserve bank of India. Now what does it mean to say\\nthat  the  entity  is  working  towards  innovation  development  deployment  or\\ncommercialization  of new  products  processor or service is driven by technology or\\nintellectual property, this is further explained in explanation for that it means that it aims\\nto develop or commercialize a new product or a process or service or significantly\\nimproved existing product or process that will create or add value to the customer or\\nwork flow.\\nNow, this kind of overlaps with the definition of an invention the invention is normally\\ngranted for a new product or a process or an improved product or a process these are the\\ntool large categories broad categories for which inventions are granted pattern. So, the\\nstatus given to a start-up is very similar to the definition of invention itself. So, the start-\\nup  should  be  working  on  developing  new  products  and  processes  which  is  what\\ninventions should be or at least it should be significantly improving existing products and\\nprocesses  improvements  can  be  filed  as  patents  for  existing  inventions  to  these  2\\ncategories are covered explanation also goes on to say that it should create value to\\ncustomers or workflow which is something kind of a utility requirements. So, the product\\nthat is patent it has to be useful or it should be capable of industrial application, so to that\\n 51  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 54}), Document(page_content='extent explanation for at maps over or overlaps with the definition of an invention itself. \\nNow how do you claim the status of a start-up if you are a start-up how do you claim that\\nstatus for that there is a new form that has been introduced that is form 28; form 28 is\\nfiled, it is submitted by a small entity or a start-up if you are a small entity under the\\nmicro small and medium enterprises act 2006 or if you are claiming that status or if you\\nare claiming the status of a start-up new file form 28. So, the requirements for claiming a\\nstart-up also involves filing form 28 and inform 28 you have to give a document that will\\nevidence the eligibility of a start-up. So, it is not just filling the form if you have been\\nincorporated since, 5 years you have to produce that your certificate of incorporation if\\nyou are claiming the start-up status because your turnover is not exceeded 25 crores then\\nyou may have to file the returns over the last few years.\\nAnd similarly, if you have to show that you are working on areas driven by technology\\nand intellectual property you may have to produce some proof to that effect. So, all the 3\\nrequirements in the definition less than 5 years from incorporation which will require a\\ncertificate of incorporation turnover being less than 25 crores may require producing the\\nannual returns or the tax returns and working towards innovation and development of\\nnew  products  processes  and services  driven by technology and intellectual  property\\nwhich is the third leg of the definition would require some description of the nature of\\nthe work done by the entity. Nature of work, nature of products, services rendered,\\nprocesses in place all these things you could produce document because to the form\\nclearly says that there has to be a document produced for claiming the status of a start-\\nup. Now, what do start-up get? why should somebody file patents as a start-up? what will\\nbe the advantage of getting the status of a start-up?\\nNow, the first advantage that start-ups get is that they will be treated at power with an\\nindividual or a natural person when it comes to the fees that an entity has to file we know\\nthat there are 3 categories of fees under the patents act and rules. Now first schedule\\ndeals with the fees payable. So, the 3 categories of fees are one we have a particular\\nstructure for a natural person or a start-up. So, the start-up gets treated like a natural\\nperson. So, the fees are the lowest you start with the lowest fee if you are a small entity\\nalone or with the natural person or a start-up. So, if you are-filing it anybody files with a\\n 52  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 55}), Document(page_content='small entity then the fee is slightly higher. Now just to give you the instance for e-filing,\\nwe have a separate structure for e-filing and different structure for physical filing and e-\\nfiling is normally cheaper than physical filing.\\nSo, if a start-up or a natural person makes a patent application under form 1 then he\\nneeds to pay 1600 rupees whereas if an application is filed as a small entity then the fee\\nis 4000 rupees that is a third category any other entity other than start up a natural person\\nor a small entity which will include all big organisations research organisations and\\ncorporations then your fee is 8000 rupees. So, the first benefit a start-up gets by filing an\\napplication using it status as a start-up is it gets it is entitled to a despite being an\\nincorporated entity it is entitled to a reduced fee rate and the fee rate is same as that of a\\nnatural person, that is the first advantage.\\nThe second advantage a start-up can avail because of its status is that it can avail itself\\nthe privilege of an expedited examination, expedited examination is where you can fast\\ntrack  your  patent  application.  So,  under  rule  24(c),  we  will  find  that  expedited\\nexamination can only be filed by an entity that is a start-up this privilege is not open for\\nany other entity. But any other entity can avail expedited examination if it is indicated\\nIndia as the competent international such authority or elected India as the international\\npreliminary examination authority in the corresponding international application, which\\nmeans that entity which is not a start-up will have to file an international application\\nchoosing India either as the ISA that is a international searching authority or the IPEA;\\nthe international preliminary examination authority.\\nNow, we know that India became a international such authority and an international\\npreliminary examination authority recently. So, if you need to fast track your application\\nyou could do that if you are a start-up if you are not a start-up then it means you need to\\nfile an international application. So, domestic applications what we call applications filed\\nin India alone cannot be expedited  if you  are not a start-up it requires  to avail an\\nexpedited  examination  it  requires  the  entity  to  file  an  international  application  the\\ninternational application may be filed and claim the expedited status they may expedite\\nthe examination and later on abandon the international application that is completely left\\nto what the entity wants to do.

Now under rule 5 the applicants have\\nrequired to furnish their email address and mobile number. So, this is a rule 5 made a\\nchange to the way in which communications happen. So, every person concerned with\\nany preceding or every pattern T shall furnish to the controller address including email\\naddress.

Now earlier courier\\nservice was an option open to sending communications to the patent office that is now\\nbeen removed courier service has now been removed. So, you can no longer send things\\nto the patent office by way of courier it has to be through post or registered post or speed\\npost or electronic transmission duly authenticated. So, these are the ways in which you\\ncan do it courier service has been removed that is a change that the 2016 act introduced\\n6(1)(a); 6(1) says the various ways in which you can do it 6(1)(a) did create some\\ncontroversy because it said that notwithstanding anything contained in rule one a patent\\nagent shall file leave make or give all documents only by electronic transmission duly\\nauthenticated.\\nNow, duly authenticated means that the patent agent should have a digital signature with\\nwhich  he will do the  electronic  filing  including  scan copies  of documents  that  are\\nrequired  to  be  submitted  in  original  provided  that  the  original  documents  that  are\\nrequired to be submitted shall be submitted within a period of fifteen days failing which\\nthe documents would be deemed not to have been filed.\\nYou need to make a note there that is another deeming provision under the patents act\\n 55  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 58}), Document(page_content='where already told you that there are various deeming provisions deemed to have been\\nabandoned  treated  to  be  abandoned  treated  as  withdrawn  this  is  another  deeming\\nposition. So, even if you make an electronic application if you do not follow it by filing\\nthe physical documents that the original documents physically, if you do not find them\\nsend them by post then it would be deemed that the application was not filed. \\nSo, one thing to note about electronic filing is that electronic filing is not electronic filing\\nin the sense of its worth it means that it is an electronic filing followed by physical file\\nand this issue came up because now if you are a patent agent the only way you can file is\\nelectronic. So, to that extend this is now another layer the patent agents will have to go\\nthrough because the patent agents who were-filing the applications physically will still\\nhave to file it physically within 15 days, but they also need to file it electronically.

This is in cases\\nwhere the draft or a banker’s cheque is sent by post what this makes when the banker’s\\ncheque or the draught actually reaches the controller that is the point at which it is\\ndeemed to have been paid. There is an option of paying it either in cash at the patent\\noffice or through electronic means these 2 options are also open in addition to sending a\\nbanker’s cheque or a bank draft.\\nAnother new aspect that was introduced in the rules by the 2016 amendments was in case\\nyou paid excess fees for a same preceding it can now be returned there is a provision by\\nwhich there can be a refund.

So, you have filed an application you have made a request for\\nexamination, but the patent office does not issue the first statement of objection. Now\\nthis is the point at which if you withdraw then the fee will be refunded to you if you\\nwithdraw the application after the first statement of objection is filed then this provision\\nwill not apply you will not get a refund.\\nThe reason being the patent office has actually started working on your application. So, if\\nyou withdraw it before the issuance of the first statement of objection then you are\\nentitled to a refund. Now to claim the refund you will have to file form 29; form 29 is a\\nnewly introduced form for withdrawing the application and section 11(b)(4) in the first\\nscheduled there are 2 tables table one deals with the fees payable table 2; table 2 you will\\nfind at the end of table one after table one that is after entry 53 of table 1, you will find\\ntable 2 which talks about fees refundable fees payable and fees refundable these are the 2\\ntables. Now in fees refundable you will find that the refund of fees under rule 7 sub rule\\n(4)(A) which can be done by filing form 29; 90 percent of the fee paid for request for\\nexamination or request for expedited examination will be received.\\nSo, the fees which  you  pay for request for examination  or a request for expedited\\nexamination will be refunded if you file an application for withdrawing the patent under\\nform 29 before issuance of the first statement of objections.\\n (Refer Slide Time: 24:09)\\n 58  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 61}), Document(page_content='There is a new provision with relating to biological material in rule 13(8); the period\\nwithin which reference to deposit shall be made in the specification under subclass a of\\nclause 2 of sub section 4 of section 10 that is 10(4)(2)(a) shall be 3 months from the date\\nof filing the application provided that in case of a request for publication under rule 24(a)\\na reference shall be made on or before the date of filing such a request.

We will also see; what are the inventions\\nthat are not patentable or the excluded subject matter, the subject matter that has been\\nexcluded from patentability; we will also look at that. Then we will look at the definition\\nof invention an invention includes three things; the invention has to be new, the fact that\\nit has to be new or novel, it should involve an inventive step and it should be capable of\\nindustrial application.\\nSo, we will individually look at the three components of what constitutes a patentable\\ninvention; novelty, inventive step and utility or industrial application. So, looking at the\\ndefinition of invention first; we can see that the definition has three components and the\\ndefinition itself qualifies an invention that is patentable. Now this is understood, if you\\nread the act no-where does the act says that, what is the patentable invention; rather\\nwhen the act refers to an invention, it is understood that the acts concern is with regard to\\npatentable inventions. \\nSo, inventions that are patentable or patentable inventions to use an alternative phase\\nrefers to the fact that there are certain inventions, which are patentable under the act;\\nwhich also means that there could be inventions which are beyond the scope of an patent\\nunder the act. Now this we referred to as the patentability of inventions or in to use the\\nphrase in our syllabus, patentability of inventions or simply patentability.\\n 71  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 74}), Document(page_content='(Refer Slide Time: 02:24)\\nWhat can be patented? Patents can be granted only for an invention that pertains to a\\nfield of technology. So, the field of technology is very important because if there is no\\nfield of technology then a patent cannot be granted. Patents are technology specific, in\\nthe sense that patents can only be granted for technological inventions. Though the\\npatents act do not describe inventions as technological inventions, it is understood that\\ntechnology; inventions are inventions that are made in a particular field of technology. In\\nfact, the patent office is designed in a way in which they have group of examiners, who\\nhave skills in a particular technology analysing and examining patent applications that\\ncome from different fields.\\nThe international patent classification which is a code that is used for classifying patents\\nis  again  a  technology-based  classification.  So,  if  you  file  a  patent  application  in\\nbiotechnology then it will be examined by group of examiners, whereas if you file a\\npatent application for a pharmaceutical drug, it would be examined by a different set of\\nexaminers. So, patent law is technology specific and you have not only experts within\\nthe patent office, but also the attorneys who draft these patents would also have some\\namount of domain knowledge in pertaining to their particular field.\\nSo, inventions under the act can be granted for a new product or a process; the invention\\n 72  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 75}), Document(page_content='should involve an inventive step and it should also be capable of industrial application.\\nNow this is the definition of invention which is mentioned in section 2(1)(j) of the\\npatents act. So, from this we can understand three things for anything to be an invention,\\nthe  fact  that  something  has  to  be  new  is  referred  to  in  patent  law  as  the  novelty\\nrequirement, something has to be novel or the novelty requirement.\\nThe invention should also involve an inventive step, I will explain inventive step in some\\ndetail soon and the invention should be capable of industrial application; this is largely\\ncall  the  utility  requirement.  Inventive  step  is  also  called  the  non-obviousness\\nrequirement, the fact that the invention should not be obvious to a person skilled in the\\nart. We will be looking at these definitions in some detail soon, now what is important\\nhere is that invention has three requirements; novelty, inventive step and utility.\\nBut for something to be an invention and for something to be captured as a patent, the\\nproduct or the invention should manifest itself in the form of a product or a process. So,\\nthat  is why you  have the new product or a process mentioned  together. So, if the\\ninvention cannot be envisage as a product or process then a patent cannot be granted. For\\ninstance, somebody envisages an invention as an idea and abstract idea; no product\\ncomes out of it, no process of manufacturing or working it is described, it just is an idea.\\nFor instance, somebody comes up with the bright idea of making a cycle that you could\\npedal to the moon. Now that remains an abstract concept, it is not something that can be\\nworked out, it is not something that there can be a product on it, but it is just an idea that\\nyou could cycle your way to the moon.\\nSo, abstract ideas cannot be patented, patent should manifest itself on either a product or\\na process. Invention can also cover improvements to existing inventions, so you have\\ninventions  which are new involved and inventive step and are capable of industrial\\napplication.  The  same  yardstick  can  also  be  applied  to  improvements  to  existing\\ninventions, provided those improvements on new; they involve an inventive step and\\nthey are capable of industrial application.\\n 73  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 76}), Document(page_content='(Refer Slide Time: 06:54)\\nPatentability refers to the ability of an invention to be granted a patent, if an invention is\\nnot capable of being granted a patent; then we would not call it a patentable invention,\\nthey are normal  inventions.  For an invention  to be patentable,  it has to satisfy the\\nrequirements of an invention under the act what you  saw under the earlier section;\\nsection 2(1)(j). Not only should it satisfy the requirements of an invention under section\\n2(1)(j), it should also get over the statutory exceptions.\\nSo, we call this as the positive and the negative thing; the positive thing is that it has to\\nshow that the invention is new or it involves novelty, it involves an inventive step and it\\nis capable of industrial application or utility, these are the positive things. So, when you\\nfile an application for a patent, you have to show that these three things do exist. Apart\\nfrom satisfying these requirements; you should also ensure that your patent or your\\napplication does not fall within the statutory exceptions; the statutory exceptions are\\ndetailed in section 3 and 4 of the patents act and the statutory exceptions are applied first.\\nSome of the exceptions in section 3 and 4 are policy based, some of them are domain\\nbased, some of them are; but exceptions which you can get over some of them are\\nabsolute exceptions, we will come to them in detail.\\nFor instance, section 4 as a bar on granting patents for anything that pertains to atomic\\n 74  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 77}), Document(page_content='energy. So, the Indian law does not grant patents on things pertaining to atomic energy so\\nthat is the blanket ban. So, the statutory exceptions are applied first and once you get\\nover the filter of the statutory exceptions, then you would be required to prove the\\npositive requirement. For instance, novelty or whether the invention is new then you will\\nhave to demonstrate that your invention has an inventive step. In US, they call as the\\nnon-obviousness and the fact that the invention is capable of industrial application; it\\ninvolves utility. So, the test of patentability involves getting over the statutory exceptions\\nand proving the ingredients of inventions that is novelty inventive step and utility.\\n 75  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 78}), Document(page_content='Patent Law for Engineers and Scientists\\nProf. Feroz Ali\\nDepartment of Management\\nIndian Institute of Technology, Madras\\nLecture – 08\\nPatentability of Inventions\\nInventions not Patentable\\nInventions not patentable, the patents act gives a list of inventions or rather it gives a list\\nof things that will not amount to an invention.\\n(Refer Slide Time: 00:27)\\nNow, these are seen as at one level these are seen as exceptions to patentability, these are\\nstatutory exceptions we call them statutory because they have been introduced by the\\npatents  act and they are exceptions  because the act says that the following are not\\ninventions within the meaning of the act; and when we say inventions we are referring to\\ninventions that cannot be patented.\\n 76  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 79}), Document(page_content='(Refer Slide Time: 01:01)\\nNow,  3(a)  talks  about  an  invention,  which  is  frivolous  or  which  claims  anything;\\nobviously contrary to well established natural laws. So, if there is an invention that is\\ncontrary to the laws of thermodynamics for instance perpetual motion machine would be\\ncontrary to the laws of thermodynamics, those inventions will be regarded as contrary to\\nthe well established natural laws and will not be granted a patent. So, anything that\\ncontravenes and well established natural law will not be deemed to be an invention under\\nthe meaning of the act. 3(b) talks about an invention the primary or intended use or\\ncommercial exploitation of which could be contrary to public order or morality or which\\ncauses serious prejudice to human animal or plant life or health to the environment. Now\\nthis exception includes things that the use of which could be contrary to public order or\\nmorality.\\nThe public order on morality is defined in a very Broadway in some jurisdictions, it\\ncould include even genetically modified animals. For instance, the Harvard Onco-mouse\\nwas granted patent in the United States, the United States patent office granted patent on\\nthe Harvard Onco-mouse which is a mouse which has a gene that is susceptible to cancer\\nthis mouse could be used for various testing various cancer drugs. So, they develop mice\\nor a mouse with this particular  gene. Though the US patent granted patent for the\\nHarvard Onco-mouse, the European patent office rejected the patent. So, you find that\\n 77  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 80}), Document(page_content='jurisdictions and in fact, the rejection from the European patent office was based on\\nsimilar ground which prohibited granting of inventions that are contrary to public order\\nor morality.\\nSimilarly, inventions that costs prejudice to human animal or plant life for health or to\\nthe environment would also come under this. So, if there is an invention that can cause\\nmass  destruction  it  could  be  captured  under  this  because  that  can  be  regarded  as\\nsomething that could seriously prejudice human animal plant life or health or to the\\nenvironment. Also, the classic example that you will find in various patent treatises is the\\none of the guillotine, the guillotine was used in Europe for executing human beings. So,\\nthis was something which was regarded as prejudicial to human life and instruments like\\nthe guillotine will not be granted patent.\\n(Refer Slide Time: 03:55)\\n3(c) talks about the mere discovery of a scientific principle or the formulation of an\\nabstract theory or discovery of any living thing or nonliving substance occurring in\\nnature. All discoveries are not patentable, now the discovery if it pertains to a scientific\\nprinciple or the formulation of an abstract theory say the theory of relativity or the\\nprinciple in science which is well established, the mere discovery of that principle or\\nformulation of a theory will not constitute an invention. We had seen earlier that for\\n 78  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 81}), Document(page_content='something to be an invention it should manifest itself in the form of a product or a\\nprocess, these are the two categories of things for which patents can be granted.\\nScientific  principle  and a theory remains  articulation  of a way in which something\\nworks, it does not necessarily encompass a product or a process for the purposes of the\\npatents act. In addition to the discovery of a scientific theory principle or an abstract\\ntheory, the discovery of any living or nonliving substance occurring in nature cannot be\\nthe subject matter of a patent. So, anything that exist in nature be it living or materials\\nsubstances cannot be the subject matter of a patent.\\nArtificially synthesized substances could be a subject matter of a patent. Section 3(d)\\ntalks about a certain kinds of substances and processes which will not be granted patent.\\nNow section 3 d comprises of 3 parts, the first part says that the mere discovery of a new\\nform of a known substance which does not result in the enhancement of the no efficacy\\nof that substance will not be regarded as an invention. Now what is not an invention was\\nthe statement with which section 3 begins; this means if there is an existing substance\\nand a new form of that substance is subsequently discovered. \\nThe fact that the new form is discovered which relates to the known substance will not\\nbe granted a fresh lease of life in the form of a fresh patent unless the patent applicant is\\nable to demonstrate an enhancement of the known efficacy of that substance, which\\nmeans the new substance or the new form of the known substance should now have an\\nefficacy effectiveness; whatever be it because in the case of drugs are now the courts of\\nheld that it has to be therapeutic efficacy in the case of pesticides, it could be the efficacy\\nin terms of its effect on pest, if it is a weedicide it could be the efficacy in terms of\\nkilling the weeds.\\nSo, we understand efficacy of substances as how effective they are for the purpose for\\nwhich they are used. So, the new form of the known substance has to have a better\\nefficacy.  Now  the  better  efficacy  should  be  what  the  act  says,  it  should  be  an\\nenhancement of what is already known. So, this tells us that when a new form of a\\nknown  substance  is  file  in  a  patent  application.  The  patent  applicant  will  have  to\\ndemonstrate what was the known efficacy of that substance and to what extend the new\\n 79  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 82}), Document(page_content='form shows an enhancement of the efficacy. Now this has to be done and this has to be\\ndemonstrated in the patent application. Largely by way of some experimental tests and\\nthere has to be some kind of data we have seen the patent office decisions, where they\\ninsist on some kind of data to demonstrate this enhancement of known efficacy.\\n(Refer Slide Time: 07:53)\\nNow, what are the new forms of known substance? The explanation gives us a much\\nbetter understanding of that, the explanation says for the purposes of this clause, salts,\\nesters, ethers, polymorphs, metabolites, pure form, particle size, isomers, mixture of\\nisomers, complexes, combinations and other derivatives of known substances shall be\\nconsidered to be the same substance. So, the salt of a substance will be considered to be\\nthe same substance, the ester form of a substance will be regarded as the same, ether\\nform,  polymorph,  metabolite,  particle  size  they  will  all  be  regarded  as  the  same\\nsubstance unless they differ significantly in properties with regard to efficacy.\\nNow, you can only claim a patent for a salt or an ester or an ether or something which is\\nalready known if you are able to demonstrate that the efficacy of the new form is\\nsignificantly  different.  Now  the  language  used  in  the  explanation  is  they  differ\\nsignificantly in properties with regard to; significant difference has to be demonstrated\\nby comparing the known efficacy by known efficacy we are referring to the efficacy of\\n 80  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 83}), Document(page_content='the known substance, and mind you this explanation pertains to specifically to the new\\nform of the known substance. \\nSo, there is an existing form of the known substance and the existing forms has an\\nefficacy, let us call it x. The new form of the known substance should have a different\\nefficacy let us say it is y. Now y minus x should be something that is significantly\\ndifferent the difference has to be significant. In some cases, there have been proof of\\nefficacy comes with quite a lot of intricate details, in some cases the patent applicants\\nhave tried to show that bio availability or increase in bio availability could be one of the\\ncharacteristics for proving enhancement of efficacy.\\nIn other cases, patent applicants have tried to show a stability of the substance, better\\nflow properties, and ease of use as properties that could demonstrate enhancement of\\nefficacy. So, we have quite a lot of patent office practice on this, there are decisions of\\nthe patent office which give the details of how it regards enhancement of efficacy, how\\nefficacy has to be proved and what kind of data the patent office expects for proving\\nefficacy.\\n(Refer Slide Time: 10:36)\\nNow, the second part of 3(d) states that the mere discovery of any new property or new\\n 81  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 84}), Document(page_content='use of a known substance shall not be an invention. This is a blanket ban in the earlier\\npart the first part we saw that the new form of a known substance will not normally be\\nconsidered for a patent, but if you demonstrate efficacy enhanced efficacy it would\\nqualify for a patent. So, there was a threshold which could be crossed and we can call\\nthat there was a hurdle which was capable of being crossed. So, that was a conditional\\nexception, a new form will not be regarded as patentable, but upon demonstration of\\nenhanced efficacy it would become patentable.\\nThe second part does not have any such way to get a patent, in other words it is a kind of\\na blanket ban. It discovery of a new property or new use of a known substance will not\\nbe treated as an invention. So, there is no way you can get over and claim a patent if you\\nare come up with the new use or a new property. \\nNow, what could be the justification for this? One justification for this blanket ban can\\nbe found in section 48 which describes the rights of a patentee. When a patent is granted\\nunder section 48 there are a set of rights that approves on the patentee, one of the right is\\nthe right to use. So, if the right to use is already granted for the known substance, a new\\nuse of the known substance should not be granted based on that logic for the mere fact\\nthat a new use was discovered, but the substance still remains the same.\\nSo, it pertains to an existing substance what the patent the had only discovered was a\\nnew use of that substance. So, there was no technological contribution by the invention,\\nit was just a discovery of what the invention could already do by the patent applicant. So,\\nthe new use was already there it just came to the knowledge of the applicant by some\\nexperimentation of by testing. So, since use is one of the rights that is granted along with\\nthe patent at the first instance, new use will not be granted a fresh lease of patent life.\\nSimilarly, new property also pertains to something which was inherent in the known\\nsubstance; it was only discovered by the applicant. So, the discovery of something which\\nis inherent like a new use or a new property which does not contribute anything new to\\nthe substance itself will not be regarded as a invention.\\nThe third part of section 3(d) states that the mere use of a known process machine or\\napparatus unless such known process results in a new product or employees at least one\\n 82  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 85}), Document(page_content='new reactant, it will not be regarded as an invention. So, the use of a known process the\\nearlier part pertains to use of a known substance in this case its use of a known process\\nmachine or apparatus. Now, using a known process machine or apparatus will not qualify\\nfor the grant of a fresh patent because the use of the process is already known or the\\nmachine or the apparatus is already known, but if the known process result in a new\\nproduct then that particular case could qualify for a fresh patent or if a employees at least\\none new reactant again in that case the use of a known process could be regarded as\\nbeing the subject matter of a separate patent.\\nNow, we do not have a very clear articulation of how this clause can be instrumental in\\ngetting a patent and we have not come across any detailed discussion either by the patent\\noffice or guidelines issued by the patent office showing how this provision shall be put\\ninto operation.\\n(Refer Slide Time: 14:59)\\nThen we have section 3(e), now we are still on the exceptions we are on what are not\\ninventions.

Now this provision allows combinations to be made, but not to be monopolized.\\nSo, you could have combinations you could have admixtures, and if the admixtures just\\nresult in the aggregation of their individual properties, then there is no need for a fresh\\ngrant of a patent life.\\nHowever, there could be cases where the admixture results not only in the aggregation of\\nproperties, but it also results in something additional to the aggregation of properties\\nwhat we call it could result in a synergy it could result in a synergistic effect.

Now in those cases where the\\nsynergistic effect is unexpected and the effect is not expected as a mere aggregation of\\nthe individual properties, in such cases you could claim the synergistic effect and that\\ncould be the subject matter of a patent.

So, that traditional knowledge say a text in an\\nancient work or text which you could find in a local language, could always be used as a\\nprior art material to question the novelty of an invention which tries to patent it.\\nSo, though traditional knowledge is available as a mechanism or rather though traditional\\nknowledge could be used for challenging novelty by questioning the novelty of that\\ninvention.  Section  3(p) provides  a special  category  for the  patent  office  to  look at\\ninstances where traditional knowledge is covered even without having to look into the\\nrequirements of patentability. The requirements of patentability are novelty the invention\\ninvolves novelty or it is new that the invention involves an inventive step and that the\\ninvention is capable of industrial application.\\nNow, even before applying these 3 steps, section 3 the exceptions in section 3 are applied\\nfirst. Now this gives the patent office the advantage of not having to look into whether\\nthere is novelty and looking at the prior art materials that can question the novelty or that\\ncan kill the novelty even without doing that, section 3(p) gives the patent office a quick\\nway to look into an invention if traditional knowledge is involved.

Section 3(d) has a history behind it, section 3(d) was\\nintroduced in 2005 and before that India went through a transition period between 1995\\nto 2005 India had taken time as a part of enforcing its WTO obligations.\\nNow, during this time they were quite a lot of applications that came into India which\\npertain to product patents for pharmaceuticals before 1995 India did not grant product\\npatents on pharmaceuticals, post 1995 till 2005 India started accepting more particularly\\nfrom 1999 onwards India start accepting applications for pharmaceutical products. Now\\nthere was a fear that earlier substances that were invented before, before 1995 could now\\ncome in some form of the other with the request for a 20-year term for a fresh patent.\\nNow  this  concern  is  in  some  cases  you  will  find  discussions  on  ever  greening  of\\npharmaceuticals;  ever  greening  is  a  term  that  is  used  which  it  would  not  that  the\\nmonopoly over the drugs could be kept for a longer time just by ensuring that series of\\npatents are filed cumulatively one after the other. So, that the total protection offered by\\nthe  series  of patents  are much  longer  than the  normal  20-year period  given to  the\\ninvention had there been only one patent.\\nNow, ever greening is something what are the pharmaceutical companies call lifecycle\\nmanagement, which is normally done in cases where products are involved and where\\nproducts at the life of a product can be extended to maximize profits; 3(d) addresses this\\nissue because 3(d) is a tool for the patent office to see that if there is a known substance\\ninvolved, and only a new form is now being claimed. Now the 3(d) gives the patent\\noffice the liberty to check that invention, if the invention actually demonstrate a better\\nefficacy is the better efficacy or the enhanced efficacy is not demonstrated then by this\\nfiction the patent office can regard the new form as something being similar to the\\nknown form. So, in affect the patent office is not doing anything, but just recognising a\\nnew form without any new benefits or without any enhancement of efficacy.\\nSo, that is the objective behind the 3(d) because 3(d) came and makes sense in a country\\n 90  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 93}), Document(page_content='which went through this transition in its law where at one point it did not grant product\\npatents for pharmaceuticals and after a period of time it started granting product patents\\nfor  pharmaceutical.  So,  there  was  this  inherent  danger  the  substances  that  were\\ndiscovered before could now be passed on as new substances by just tweaking their\\nform. So, that is the reason why the 3(d) came into being; certain other objection are\\nexceptions in section 3 like mere discovery of a scientific principle, formulation of an\\nabstract theory, these are known even other jurisdictions have similar exceptions. This is\\nto ensure that ideas or concepts are not patented or what should be patented should be a\\nworkable or an idea in working which results in a product or in a process or method of\\nmanufacturing or method of doing something.\\nApart from section 3 section 4 also includes some exceptions that cannot be patented.\\nSection 4 states inventions relating to atomic energy cannot be patented; section 4 clearly\\nmentions that no patent shall be granted in respect of an invention relating to atomic\\nenergy falling within subsection 1 of section 20 of the atomic energy act 1962.

Now invention has to pertain to a technology or it could also be an invention\\n 94  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 97}), Document(page_content='per se now we understand invention to pertaining only to technology because in practice\\npatent law has evolved only by granting patterns for technology there is no other field for\\nwhich patents can be granted. So, if there is no technology or if there is no technical\\neffect produced by an invention, we do not regard that is patentable.\\nSo, any invention or technology which has not been anticipated now this is phrase that\\nyou need to understand it is a word that you need to understand. Anticipation is discussed\\nin detail in chapter 6 of the patents act, section 29 to 34. There, anticipation contains all\\nthe exceptions to anticipation what are the instances that do not amount to anticipation.\\nSo, here we understand this statement as something if an invention or technology has not\\nbeen anticipated then it is regarded as new, now anticipation can happen in multiple ways\\nanticipation can happen by publication in any document or by used in a country or\\nelsewhere before the date of in a country or elsewhere.\\n(Refer Slide Time: 04:12)\\nSo, that gives us the standard of anticipation is a global standard regardless of whether\\nthe invention was anticipated in a particular country, as long as it is anticipated in any\\npart of the world it could still affect the novelty of an invention. Meaning which if you\\nfile a patent application in India, they could be a disclosure by publication in scientific\\njournal in the united states and even if you assume for moment that particular journal is\\n 95  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 98}), Document(page_content='not available in India still the standard of novelty which is an absolute standard which\\ntakes the notary requirement is determined by looking at the prior art all over the world\\nstill the invention would stand anticipated.\\nNow in a moment we will come to what we understand by anticipation now here from\\nthe statement we can conclude that anticipation can be broadly by 2 ways it can be by\\npublication in a document or used in any country. So, these are the 2 ways in which an\\ninvention can be anticipated. Publication is easy to understand because publication of the\\ninvention discloses the invention to the world at large in a verifiable manner that is the\\nadvantage of a publication. Publication would record the invention and it is verifiable say\\nif it is published in an earlier patent application then it is there as a record which can be\\nverified and that earlier patent application could become what we call a prior art for the\\npresent application the application for which a novelty determination is being done. \\nSo, publication by a document any document means that it is published which means it is\\ndisclosed to the public or in patent law we use the word made available to the public and\\nit is in such a way that the publication is in a verifiable manner. So, if someone is filing\\nan application for a particular invention that application as it discloses an invention can\\nbe  checked  for novelty  or  for  lack  of  it  in  a  published  document  which  has  been\\npublished before the date of application. So, the prior art is always the date before which\\nthe priority for that particular application accrues. So, publication by any document is in\\neasier way of ascertaining anticipation because published documents allow you to verify\\nwhether a document that has a disclosure of an invention actually anticipates a patent\\napplication. \\nThe second type of anticipation is a bit more difficult to ascertain because use in a\\ncountry could be use that is unrecorded could be use that is not documented. So, when\\nthe use itself is there, but it is not recorded or documented then it becomes difficult\\nthough not impossible to prove anticipation for instance, under section 13 which is cross\\nreferenced here the examiner has to file a report on novelty that is whether the invention\\nhas  been  anticipated.  So,  when  the  examiner  does  a  report  on  anticipation,  he  is\\nessentially looking at data bases which means he is looking at documents that have been\\npublished before if there is a use in the same country in where the examiner is examining\\n 96  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 99}), Document(page_content='the patent. And for a moment let us assume that that use has not been documented it\\nbecomes difficult to prove which means if the issue of novelty is to be raised then the\\nissue of novelty will be reached before either a court of law or an appellate body or the\\npatent office in such a manner that the use will now be shown by evidence adduced by a\\nperson because whatever is not recorded or whatever is not documented can still be\\nadduced as evidence provided there is a testimony.\\nSo,  for  instance  if  there  was  use  of  an  invention  then  the  way  in  which  we  will\\nunderstand that use is by people who have witnessed the use filing an affidavit and\\nswearing a statement that they actually witness the use now. It is difficult to prove used\\nby an affidavit filed by a person because that would; obviously, involve examination of\\nthe person and if somebody is disputing that as a piece of evidence that person also has\\nto be cross examined, now examination cross examination are legal procedures involved\\nwhen a person deposes as a witness. So, use which is not documented though it is\\nrelevant for understanding anticipation it is more difficult or harder to prove then the\\nother aspect of anticipation which can be proved by publication of any document.\\nSo, world over largely anticipation or the lack of novelty the fact that an invention does\\nnot have novelty is proved predominantly by publication of documents and if you see the\\nreport of any of the patent office on anticipation, they would largely rely on documents\\nto show that there is no anticipation. If you look at the report by the pct preliminary\\nreport the x category which says that the invention is not novel again they would rely on\\npublished documents to say that there is no novelty of for the invention. So, novelty\\nunder the act is defined by the definition new invention this is under section 2(1)(l) and\\nwe had seen that anticipation can be by 2 means publication and by use. \\nNow we had also mentioned that it is a global standard and the fact that it should be\\nbefore the filing of the patent application with the complete specification. Now the date\\nthat is that brings us to another important aspect of determining novelty. First, we saw\\nthat there is a subject matter category there has to be an invention or a technology. So,\\nunless the patent pertains to an invention or a technology then only such subject matters\\nare capable of being patented.\\n 97  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 100}), Document(page_content='For instance, section 3 excludes literary and artistic works. So, in the fact that something\\nfrom this with the domain of copyright law cannot be subject matter of patent, it has to\\nbe an invention as defined under the act or it has to pertain it to a field of technology\\nwhich is not been anticipated by publication anticipation is the fact that it has been\\ndisclosed before now and when we talked about the fact that the disclosure has happened\\nthere are 2 kinds of disclosure.\\n(Refer Slide Time: 11:41)\\nSo, the first key thing in understanding novelty is that it should pertain to an invention or\\na technology that is a subject matter. Second that it should be disclosed either by an\\ndocument published in any document or buy use that is the manner of disclosure the first\\none was subject matter in anticipation the second element was the manner of disclosure it\\ncould either be in a document or in a use and use has to be proved by evidence adduced\\nto demonstrate that use. The third important element of novelty or the fact that an\\ninvention is new is that it should be the disclosure or the thing that anticipates should\\nhave  happened  before  the  date  of  filing  the  patent  application  with  complete\\nspecification. So, this is the date by which we determine the novelty of an invention. \\nIf the disclosure or if the anticipating material happened before the date of filing the\\npatent application with complete specification then it is at that point we are going to look\\n 98  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 101}), Document(page_content='at the prior art the prior art for determining novelty will be the prior art before the date of\\nfiling the patent application with the complete specification. Now anticipation is defined\\nhere what do we mean by anticipation? By anticipation we mean that the subject matter\\nhas not fallen in the public domain or it is does not form a part of the state of the art now.\\nIf it is fallen into the public domain and if it is not protected by secrecy and secrecy\\nsomething which you will see that there are certain measures even if it falls within the\\npublic domain it will still be a protected disclosure because there was a breach of certain\\ncontraction obligations. So, if it is not protected by secrecy and it falls into the public\\ndomain, we would say that the matter is anticipated or it does not form a part of the state\\nof the art.\\nNow, if something does not form a part of the state of the art then it is new if the subject\\nmatter has not fallen into the public domain then again it is new or it satisfies novelty.\\nSo, when we freeze it in the negative if something has fallen into the public domain then\\nit lacks novelty or if something forms a part of the state of the art it again lacks novelty.\\nSo, anticipation is the key ingredient for determining novelty and anticipation is done.\\nThe method by which it is done either by looking at published documents or by looking\\nat use in a particular country or the world at large.\\n(Refer Slide Time: 14:44)\\n 99  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 102}), Document(page_content='In determining novelty there are certain steps the patent office or the court would take\\nthe first thing what we had already mentioned is contained in the definition itself the\\ndefinition states that for the purposes of determining novelty you should look at the\\ndocuments or the use before the date of filing the patent application with the complete\\nspecification. \\nNow you may ask why is it that we cannot look at the date of filing of the provisional\\napplication because provisional is done before the complete in cases where provision is\\nfiled then why is not a novelty determination done from the date of the provision.

So, they could be subscription websites where a\\npiece of disclosure is published, but it is not available to the public unless a person pays\\nthe subscription fee that would still amount to the public domain. \\nThe fact that something is behind the wall, behind the pay wall and it requires payment\\nof money will not take it away from the public domain that would never the less be the\\npublic domain, but it would still be a protected space, but nevertheless it is the public\\ndomain and the fact that something has to be in the public domain is not equated to\\nsomething being available free of cost. So, that is a critical point be noted the public\\ndomain could also include subscription websites or material that is been posted behind\\nthe pay wall.\\nState of the art means the state of technology rather than the state of art in commerce of\\nbusiness. So, whenever we talk about the state of art, art refers to the technology. So,\\nwhen we talk about novelty or for that matter even inventive step we are only concerned\\nabout the technical features we are not concerned about any other feature of an invention\\nthere may be some features and inventions in which the customers like or which helps in\\nspreading the word about the invention or there could be some social features which\\npeople find interesting, but when we are talking about an invention we are specifically\\nlooking at the technical features. So, novelty just like an inventive step is determined\\nusing looking at the technical features of the invention.\\nNow, the question of novelty involves when did the prior art disclose invention the point\\nat which the disclosure happened and when they did anticipate what which means the\\ndocument or the use that actually anticipated it and under what circumstances was it\\nmade available to the public, so 3 things. One is a when the second is what and the third\\none under which circumstances it was made available to the public.

There are case laws which says that in determining novelty\\nanalysis even if the disclosure is made to one person that would amount to killing the\\nnovelty of an invention which means that even a disclosure made to one person if the\\nperson is not bound by any contract or secrecy obligations for instance there was no non\\ndisclosure agreement with that person or the person was not under the employment of a\\ncompany where he was bound by the terms and conditions of his employment not to\\ndisclose the invention, if such a person even if he is one person if a disclosure is made to\\nhim that would amount to a novelty killing disclosure. So, it is not when we use the word\\npublic in public domain even a disclosure made to one person will be regarded as a\\ndisclosure made to the public and it will be regarded that it was made available to the\\npublic.\\nNow, in determining novelty the general rule is that an invention lacks novelty where\\nthere is complete correspondence between all of the technical features of the application\\n 103  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 106}), Document(page_content='and the item of prior art. Now there has to be a complete match of all the technical\\nfeatures  as  disclosed  in  the  application  and  as  compared  to  the  prior art.  It is  not\\nsufficient that just the essential features are common in the prior art and the application\\nrather all the technical features have to be disclosed. \\nSo, novelty analysis would require a claim to be mapped exactly in all its technical\\nfeatures on to the prior art. So, the subject matter will not be anticipated if some features\\nin a claim are mapped on to a disclosure in the prior art where as there are other technical\\nfeatures which do not have which are not disclosed in that prior art. Now what happens\\nwhen the prior art disclosure affecting novelty is not in a single document? Say there are\\n2 different documents and the 2 different documents disclose all the technical features\\nput together of the application, in other words the application has a set of technical\\nfeatures which can be map to prior art a, it also has a set of other technical features in the\\nclaim which can be map to prior art b. So, how does a person look at a novelty analysis\\nwhen the disclosure is in different documents? \\nNow the rule in determining novelty is that mosaicing or comparing different documents\\nis not permissible for the purposes of determining novelty. So, there must be individual\\nand  separate  comparison  between  the  claimed  in  initial  and  the  prior  art.  So,  the\\ncomparison is going to be individual and it is going to be separate a person will not be\\nallowed to do a mosaicing; a mosaicing is comparing different documents reading them\\ntogether. So, whereas mosaicing is allowed to be done when it is a determination of lack\\nof inventive step which is the second requirement of patentability.\\nIn some cases, you will find that the documents because it is not permissible to read them\\ntogether or it is not permissible to mosaic them the documents will not disclose or will\\nnot  be  the  disclosures  in  a  document  cannot  prove  lack  of  novelty  because  the\\ndisclosures  are  in  different  places.  But  the  same  documents  could  be  used  for\\ndetermining lack of inventive step and in that case mosaicing is permitted. Now we will\\nlook at how that happens when we discuss inventive step.\\nSo, when you are looking at a novelty analysis you would also keep the inventive step\\nanalysis  at  the  back  of  your  mind  because  the  same  documents  can  be  used  for\\n 104  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 107}), Document(page_content='determining lack of inventive step. So, what distinguishes the novelty requirement from\\nan inventive step requirement is the fact that the invention in an inventive step analysis is\\nseen  as  whether  it  was  obvious  to  a  person  skilled  in  the  art.  So,  that  brings  the\\nknowledge of the person skilled in the art what we call the mental element which is\\nabsent in a novelty analysis. In a novelty analysis your soul concern is whether the\\ninvention  as  disclosed  in  the  patent  application  has  been  anticipated  before  by\\npublication or by use. And, in anticipation you are going to look for a complete matching\\nof the invention in the prior art. So, it does not give the disclosure that you find in the\\nprior art should be a complete disclosure which maps all the technical features that have\\nbeen claimed in a patent application.\\n 105  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 108}), Document(page_content='Patent Law for Engineers and Scientists\\nProf. Feroz Ali\\nDepartment of Management\\nIndian Institute of Technology, Madras\\nLecture – 10\\nPatentability of Inventions\\nAnticipation\\n(Refer Slide Time: 00:16)\\nChapter 6 of the Patents Act deals with anticipation. Chapter 6 starts with section 29 and\\nit goes all the way till section 34, so 29 to 34 deals with anticipation. 29 to 34 deals with\\ninstances which are excluded from anticipation and we understand anticipation as a\\nsituation where an invention is covered by the prior art, an invention as claimed in the\\ncomplete specification has been already disclosed or covered in the prior art. Now in the\\nprior art it could be by prior publication, it could be by prior claiming, it could be by\\nprior knowledge, it could be by prior use, it could also will be by prior disclosure in a\\nlocal community what we call by anticipation by traditional knowledge.\\nSo, anticipation has different categories largely they fall into four categories; anticipation\\nby prior publication before the date of priority of the matter claimed was disclosed; so\\nthat is what we call anticipation by publication. The second category is anticipation by\\nprior claiming; a claim in a specification anticipated the invention though they claim\\n 106  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 109}), Document(page_content='would have been published later on. Now this will cover instances where one application\\nwhich is  still in the dormant  phase in the 18-month  unpublished phase; anticipates\\nanother application which comes later on. So, there we look at prior claiming because in\\npatent law there is this 18-month unpublished period and they could be anticipation of\\none invention that can happen during that period. So, prior claiming covers instances\\nrelating to anticipation by an unpublished application, so that is the second part.\\nThe  first  is  anticipation  by  prior  publication,  the  second  type  of  anticipation  is\\nanticipation by prior claiming. In claiming we are trying to map one claim with an earlier\\nclaim of an patent application. The third category is anticipation by public use or public\\nknowledge, you can say it prior use or prior knowledge; there you can use these words\\ninterchangeably. So, this is a type of anticipation here it need not be a case of comparing\\ndocuments; in the first two cases trial publication and prior claiming anticipation is can\\nbe proved by comparing documents, but when it involves prior use and prior knowledge\\nor public use and public knowledge in India; then it can be done by taking or letting in\\nevidence. \\nSo, it need not be a mapping of documents which is a normal way in which anticipation\\nis proved; that is the third category anticipation by public use or public knowledge, the\\nwords used in section 25(1) and (2) are a publicly known or publicly used in India. The\\nfourth category is anticipation by traditional knowledge, the knowledge that was with a\\nlocal or a traditional community anticipated the invention; these are the four categories\\nof anticipation mentioned under the Act. \\n29 talks about anticipation by previous publication the first category and it tells us about\\ninstances where certain cases will not be treated as anticipation 29(1) and invention\\nclaim in a complete specification shall not be deemed to have been anticipated by reason\\nonly  that  the  invention  was  published  in  a  specification  filed  in  pursuance  of  an\\napplication made in India; dated before the 1st day of January, 1912. So, we had already\\nmentioned the date 1st January, 1912 is significant because that is the day the 1911 Act\\ncame into being. The 1911 Act was the Act that preceded the 1970 Act. The 1911 Act\\nwas called the Indian patents and designs act 1911 and the 1911 Act came into effect on\\n1st January 1912.\\n 107  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 110}), Document(page_content='So, the Indian patent office has been receiving application since 1912; this is under the\\nsystem that was established by the British. So, an invention shall claim in a specification\\nshall not be deemed to have been anticipated by reason only that the invention was\\npublished in a specification file in pursuance of an application for a patent made in India\\nand dated before 1st Jan, 1912. Before 1st Jan, 1912 we did not have a formal patent\\nsystem, but still we had certain executive privileges granted by the British government. \\nSo, there is similar to a patent you could make an application and the British government\\nwould grant a patent if there were any disclosures made in an application; made in India\\nand dated before 1912, then that would not amount  to anticipation because we are\\nexcluding documents before 1912 for the simple fact that the patent office was not\\nfunctioning at that point. So, this is a redundant provision because today there is no\\nprotection offered, we did not even compare cases where documents where published or\\nlook into documents that were published before 1912.\\n29(2) Subject as here in after provided, an invention claimed in a complete specification\\nshall not be deemed to have been anticipated; again an exception to anticipation by\\nreason only that the invention was published before the priority date of the relevant\\nclaim, if the patentee of the applicant for the patent proves; that the matter published was\\nobtained from him or where he is not the true and first inventor; from any person whom\\nhe derives title, and was published without consent or the consent of any such person.\\n 108  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 111}), Document(page_content='(Refer Slide Time: 07:28)\\n(b) where the patentee of the applicant for the patent or any person from whom he\\nderives  title  of  the  publication  before  the  date  of  the  application  or  in  case  of  a\\nconvention application, before the date of the application for protection in a convention\\ncountry, that the application or the application in the convention country, as a case may\\nbe, was made as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter.\\n(Refer Slide Time: 07:50)\\n 109  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 112}), Document(page_content='Provided that the sub-section shall not apply if the invention was before the priority date\\nof the claim commercially worked in India, otherwise than for purposes of reasonable\\ntrial, either by the patentee or by a person who derives title with the consent of the\\npatentee or the applicant for the patent or any person from whom he derives title.\\nNow, in short this means that disclosures made before the priority date, an invention that\\nis disclosed before the priority date which was done without the consent of the patentee\\nor the applicant  will not amount  to anticipation. For instance, there are a group of\\nscientists who worked for an organisation and the scientist are bound by a non-disclosure\\nagreement within that organisation by which all of them are not supposed to disclose the\\ninvention without the consent of the organisation.\\nNow if one of the scientist disclosures or publishes the matter without the consent of the\\norganisation,  then  that  matter  which  was  published  cannot  be  used  as  anticipation\\nbecause it was done without the consent of the owner. The owner tries to keep it safe,\\nthere was an agreement binding the people to whom it was disclosed, the person who\\nwas under in agreement breached that agreement and put it in the public domain or\\ndisclose it.\\nSo, any disclosure that happens before the date of priority for which the patentee or the\\napplicant had not given consent; will not amount to anticipation. So, this is a way in\\nwhich the interest of the applicant is protected. Now consent is one part of this scheme,\\nthe  disclosure  to  the  public,  the  publication  before  the  priority  date  should  have\\nhappened without the consent of the patentee or the applicant. So, he has to prove that\\nthe matter was published was obtained from him or from another person who’s with\\nwhom he had an arrangement and was published without the consent. So, first he has to\\nprove that the disclosure happened without his consent.\\nSecondly, which is covered in (b) he has to follow it up with an application as soon as\\npossible. So, he came  to know about the publication;  he did not want the material\\ncovered in the disclosure to come into the public domain, but it had come. So, he should\\nquickly file an application in the case, it is an Indian application you should file one or\\nwhere an application covers a convention country, he should make the application as\\n 110  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 113}), Document(page_content='soon as reasonably practicable; so, this is the second condition.\\nFirst condition is he says that the disclosure was made without my consent, but soon\\nafter he found that about the publication; the disclosure he should move and make an\\napplication because this is logical because the only way you can get the benefit of an\\nearlier disclosure is that the moment you found that you are entitled to a grace period,\\nyou would operate within that grace period.\\nNow, this is not similar to antedating because the person will not get an earlier priority,\\nbut this is what we call a grace period and here the grace period is not mentioned the\\ngrace  period  is  you  should  make  the  application  as  soon  as  reasonably practicable\\nthereafter. So, you wanted to keep your invention a secret, but somebody disclosed it\\nwithout your consent; soon after you knew about it maybe you come to know about the\\npublication after few days, weeks or months.\\nSoon after you came to know about it, you made an application as soon as reasonably\\npracticable. So, the requirement if somebody asks you; what is the grace period under\\nsection 29(2)? The grace period can be 12 months from the date of disclosure, 6 months\\nfrom the date of disclosure as soon as reasonably practicable from the date of disclosure\\nor from the date of publication or another choice or none of the above. Then the correct\\nanswer, in  a case  involving  29;  will  be  the  grace  period  is  as  soon as  reasonably\\npracticable.\\nYou will see in the other cases, the grace period is specifically mentioned as 12 months,\\nbut in this case a 12 month may not be meaningful because a person may come to know\\nabout the publication after 24 months quite possible. So, in this case what is important is\\nto look at when the publication came to prove that the publication happens without the\\nconsent and as soon as knowing the publication, as soon as you get to know that the\\npublication happen; file an application as soon as reasonably practicable.

So, you can say that yes I\\ncommercially worked it, but that was for reasonable trail, you could still claim that\\nexception. But this provision covers commercial working other than for reasonable trial,\\nyou really wanted to earn money and you were not doing a beta test; either by the\\npatentee or the applicant from whom we entitle our consent.\\nSo, the exception is you can claim the grace period or you can say that something is not\\nanticipated under 29(2), provided you prove that the publication happened without your\\nconsent and you quickly followed up within patent application, there is no time line\\ngiven; it is as soon as reasonably practicable. Now, you will not be entitled to 29(2) if\\nyou commercially work the invention because you are contradicting your own stand that\\nsomebody else released my invention, when I myself have commercially worked it. \\nSo,  commercial  working  is  an  Act  that  can  kill  the  novelty  of  an  invention.

So,  an  application  that  is  filled  shall  not  be\\nanticipating by using only that any other application for a patent in respect of the same\\ninvention was made, in contravention of the rights of that person.\\n29(3) can be illustrated by an example, assume that application b is filed by a true and\\nfirst inventor or an assignee or a legal representative, a person who can is entitled be an\\napplicant under the Act. Application b is filed by a person who is entitled to file that\\napplication, an application b covers an invention there has been an earlier application;\\napplication a; which covers the same invention  but it is not filed by the applicant,\\nsomebody else filed it.

So, the first scenario says that if application a is filed in\\ncontravention of the rights of an applicant b; who files application b, then the earlier\\nfiling will not anticipate the later filing; simple reason it was done in contravention of the\\nrights. The second situation is application a is filed in January, sometime in March or in\\nApril; the invention is either used or the application is published without the consent of\\nthe person. \\nSo, here is a case that applicant b’s application was filed in October, applicant a who\\ncountermines the right of applicant b; application a is filed in January, but in March and\\nApril there has been a use or a publication.

Now  novelty\\nrequirement we had seen involves a comparison of a document that has been published\\nor a use with the claim of a patent application.\\nSo, it is a comparison if the comparison matches in all the technical features, then the\\ninvention is said to have been anticipated provided there are no secrecy provisions and\\nthe prior art document predates the date of filing of an application with the complete\\nspecification we saw that in the definition. The definition of new invention did not\\nmention anything about the person skilled in the art there was no person or the entity\\nwho would be instrumental in the analysis was not there. Whereas, the construction for a\\nnovelty analysis would be in from the perspective of a person skilled in the art, because\\nall patterns are address to a person skilled in the art it is a hypothetical construct. But the\\nperson skilled in the art himself is not instrumental in determining novelty, because the\\ndefinition of new inventions simply does not mention anything about the person skilled\\nin the art, whereas in an inventive step analysis that key ingredient is to see whether the\\ninvention was not obvious to a person skilled in the art.\\nSo, the person skilled in the art comes into the picture for an inventive step analysis and\\nthe person skilled in the art is attributed various treats. For instance, a person skilled in\\n 128  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 131}), Document(page_content='the art is attributed to know every knowledge in that particular domain that has been\\npublished or that forms a part of the common general knowledge he is attributed to it,\\nbecause he is in a hypothetical construct the person skilled in the art is attributed some\\ncases have attributed a capacity of not getting bored which means if there are thousands\\nof documents which form the knowledge of or the common general knowledge of a\\nparticular art. Then the person skilled in the art would be attributed knowledge of all\\nthose thousand documents meaning which it would be assumed that he has read all those\\ndocument.\\nSo, he has a capacity to understand things in the particular art and that capacity is almost\\ninfinite  in  the  sense  that  he  will  not  be  expected  to  get  bored  in  the  process  of\\nunderstanding the scope of the prior art now what cuts the person skilled art and inventor\\nwho has come up with the patentable invention is that the person skilled in the art though\\nhe had the entire knowledge pertaining to the art he was not able to make that inventive\\nleap or that inventive step. Now the inventive step there are various analysis which tells\\nus what the inventive step is we just understand an inventive step as a step from the prior\\nart to the invention which is a non-obvious step a person in the art would not; obviously,\\ntake that step it is non-obvious which means not every person in the art who has the\\nknowledge of the art would take that particular step.\\nNow, there are prior are art sticks for determining what that step is one art stick which is\\nnow a part of the definition is technical advancement. So, the art advanced to a particular\\npoint and the entire art that is the field of technology was at a particular point of\\ndevelopment the invention which claims to have any inventive step or which involves\\ninventive  step  made  in  advancement  from  that  point  what  is  contained  the  phrase\\ntechnical advance as compared to the existing knowledge. So, there was a technical\\nadvancement and that was a substantial advancement not something which a person\\nskilled in the art could have foreseen.\\nSo, that was a substantial advancement and the substantial advancement is something\\nwhich is not an obvious extension of what the work that is normally done or the courts\\nare  also  use  the  word  workshop  improvement  or  workshop  variation  by  workshop\\nimprovement or workshop variation we understand the various things a person skilled in\\n 129  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 132}), Document(page_content='the art would do if he is encountered with a problem. So, there is a problem and to solve\\nthe problem,  you  can attribute  the person skilled  in the art  in a particular  field  of\\ntechnology to do various courses or take request to various steps. And all the steps if it\\nresults in something what could be claimed as an invention will still not amount to have\\nsatisfied the requirement of an inventive step, because those steps the person skilled in\\nthe art would have anyway taken if he was faced with a problem.\\nSo, anything that would be done ordinarily by a person skilled in the art will not be\\nregarded as constituting are contributing to the inventive step.\\n(Refer Slide Time: 07:58)\\nSo the first step in understanding an inventive step is to determine the person skilled in\\nthe art who is the person skilled in the art to whom is the invention address to the person\\nskilled in the art is actually. The addressee of an invention the invention is addressed to\\nhim though an invention can be read by anyone and understood by anyone the invention\\nis phrased in a manner in which it can be understood by a person skill in the art.\\nSo, the person skilled in the art is a hypothetical construct which is created for an\\nobviousness analysis and the courts in many cases the first step the court will do is to\\nidentify the field of technology to which because in some inventions the inventive part or\\n 130  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 133}), Document(page_content='the inventor step may come from different fields of technology.

And from that person once they identify that person it not be a\\nperson in the modern world it could be a team of people from the perspective of that\\nperson the court will now try to analyse whether the invention involved in inventive step.\\nMosaicing which we had said is not permissible for a novelty analysis is allowed in\\ndetermining inventive step because the person skilled in the art is capable of reading\\nmultiple documents taking things from multiple documents putting them together and\\nseeing whether particular problem can be solved. So, the approach of a person skilled in\\nthe art is when he is face to the problem when he is face to the technical problem he\\nwould normally do everything his peer would do if everything that his peer would do\\nthen that would not make the invention to have an inventive step, because the problem\\ngot solved by a person skilled in the art doing what anybody else would have done if\\nfaced with problem.\\nSo, mosaicing is allowed for determining an inventive step whereas, it is not allowed for\\ndetermining a novelty step and for determining a novelty analysis for the ring simple\\nreason novelty analysis have to be a perfect match of the disclosure in the complete\\nspecification. And in the prior art it has to be a perfect match it has to be complete that\\nthe match  has to be complete  all  the technical  features  has  to be disclosed in one\\ndocument in one place. Whereas, because the inventive step involves the person skilled\\nin the art the person skilled in the art will be attributed the skill of combining and reading\\ntogether documents.\\n 131  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 134}), Document(page_content='(Refer Slide Time: 10:56)\\nNow there are different approaches in determining step one is the problem and solution\\napproach the problem and solution approach is to look at the invention as a solution to an\\nexisting problem there was an existing problem and that problem could not be solved by\\nthe person skilled in the art in that particular field and the problem existed either it\\nexisted for a long time or the fact that people were repeatedly trying to prove that\\nproblem and solve that problem and they were unsuccessful. The problem if it got\\naddressed by an invention then we would say that the invention solved an existing\\nproblem. So, this is called a problem solution approach there is a problem that existed in\\nthe prior art and the documentation in the prior art shows that there is a problem and the\\ninvention actually solve that problem.\\nSo, the problem solution approach is an important tool in pattern drafting because once\\nyou envisage the invention as a solution to a particular problem then it becomes easier to\\ndemonstrate inventive step, because the invention is now presented in the claims as a\\nsolution to an existing problem. Now there are three stages in the problem solution\\napproach the first stage what are we doing in a problem solution approach in the problem\\nsolution approach we are trying to determine whether an invention involves in inventive\\nstep. So, there is an invention which is disclosed in a patent application which is filed\\nalong with a complete specification. So, we have a claim which discloses an invention\\n 132  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 135}), Document(page_content='now we want to ascertain whether this claim stands clear of an inventive step analysis.\\nSo, one of the approach and this is predominantly followed by the European patent office\\nis a problem solution approach and in the problem solution approach the first step would\\nbe to determine the closest prior art because as we mentioned if we understand the\\ninventive step as a step taken from the prior art which a person skilled in the art could\\nnot take then it means the step was taken from the closest prior art. So, the closest prior\\nart they could be multiple prior arts in a particular domain what was the prior art that was\\nclosest to this invention. So, the first step will be in determining the closest prior art. So,\\nif there is a mistake or an error in identifying the closest prior art, then your problem\\nsolution approach for determining inventive step will be faulty because you did not\\nidentify the closest prior art.\\nSo, the closest prior art will tell you whether the leap from the closest prior art or to use\\nthe steps from the closest prior art was something which was not obvious to a person\\nskilled in the art. So, the first step in the problem solution approach is to determine the\\nclosest prior art. Second step is to establish the objective technical problem to be solved\\nnow we identify the closest prior art. And the second step is to establish the objective\\ntechnical problem. Now these are phrases which has come from the European courts we\\nmay simply phrase it as what was the technical problem because the closest prior art\\nwould have enumerated the problem, but it would not have solved it.\\nSo,  first  we  identify  the  closest  prior  art  then  we  establish  the  objective  technical\\nproblem to be solved. So, we define the problem or we identify the problem to be solved\\nand the third step is considering whether or not the claimed invention starting from the\\nclosest prior art and the objective technical problem would have been obvious to a\\nskilled person that is a obviousness analysis. So, we start from the closest prior art and\\nkeep the technical problem in mind and see whether the invention would have been\\nobvious to a person. So, it still and analysis of weather from the closest prior art keeping\\nin mind the problem to be solved a person could have done this let us take the example\\nof a paper clip.\\nThe paper clip when it was first invented it did the job of holding papers together without\\ndamaging them let us assume that the prior art before the paper clip was a wire which has\\n 133  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 136}), Document(page_content='to be pierced through the document or it was some find some kind of a clip which had to\\nbind the document which could damage the document. So, the paper clip solved the\\nproblem of holding papers together without damaging them. Now the paper clip is a\\nquite a simple invention, because it is a steel wire which is bent appropriately in places to\\nhold paper in between the wire. Now what would be the closest prior art for a paper clip\\nthe closest prior art could be a clip the closest prior art could be a steel wire it could be a\\nthread, I could be punching machine and which could punch holes on multiple document\\nand tie it up it could be. So, of the list of prior arts that are there the first step will be to\\ndetermine the closest prior art.\\nLet us assume it is a steel wire which can be pierced through the document and tie it\\ntogether let us assume for the sake of understanding this better. Now once we identify a\\nsteel wire or a bit of a wire as prior art closest prior art and by this we understand that it\\nis either disclosed it is manufactured or it is disclosed in some document. Now we\\nunderstand  what  is  the  technical  problem  that  had  to  be  solved  objective  technical\\nproblem to be solved the objective technical problem to be solved is managing paper or\\ngrouping paper together without damaging them. So, to keeping holding paper together if\\nyou stick the paper together when you remove them apart it damages them if you stitch\\nthem together it damages them, if you put a hole and tie it up with a string or with a\\nthread it again damages them.\\nSo, if we understand the issue of the problem to be solved by the paper clip as holding\\npaper together without damaging them then we will say that the technical problem or the\\nobjective technical problem to be solved is to manage papers together without managing\\nthem now we have the closest prior art which is a steel wire and we have the problem of\\nmanaging paper together without damaging them. \\nNow with these two things will it be obvious to a person to come up with a paper clip.\\nNow if the answer is yes it would be obvious then paper clip would not solve or would\\nnot involve an inventive step and it would not be granted a patent, but history tells us that\\nthere are multiple patents over paper clips over a period of time especially from the US\\npatent office and history also tells us that paper clip was a hugely successful product\\nwhich had got which had multiple patents on over a over a long period of time. So, the\\n 134  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 137}), Document(page_content='problem the first paper clip solved was managing paper without damaging them if you\\nlook at the prior art which was just a steel wire it would have been difficult for a person\\nat that point to envisage a steel wire in a such a way that it could be used to hold paper\\nwithout damaging them. So, this was the problem that was solved by the paper clips.\\nSo, the starting point of the closest prior art we will assume that is a steel wire it is a\\nplain steel wire and the objective technical problem which we will assume that managing\\npaper holding paper together without damaging them in anyway. So, that you could\\nremove the papers and use them as they were in it is original condition if a person who\\nknew the closest prior art and the technical problem could have solved it prior art by\\ncoming up with a paper clip by bending a steel wire in particular places to hold the paper\\nif the analysis would allow that to happen then we would we say that the invention\\nwould not involved in inventive step.\\nIf on the other hand if it can be ascertain that it would not have been obvious to a person\\nwho had a steel wire and papers to manage and this problem of damaging paper then\\ninvention would be non-obvious or the invention would involve an inventive step now\\none of the things that affects an inventive step analysis is hindsight now hindsight is very\\ncan be demonstrate well in the case of a paper clip. Now if you reverse engineer a paper\\nclip you get a steel wire, if you unbent it you get a steel wire. So, it could be possible for\\npeople to assume that in hindsight that this is obvious, because it was just a simple piece\\nof wire that was bent in few places. So, one of the principle is that when assessing\\ninventive step it is important to avoid viewing the solution with hindsight that is an ex\\npost facto analysis you should not view the invention with hindsight because in hindsight\\nit would appear that the invention was obvious.\\nSo, the problem solution approach helps us to avoid hindsight and that is a great way in\\nwhich patterns can be drafted because in drafting when you use the problem solution\\napproach you are actually eliminating the possibility of hindsight creeping in avoiding\\nhindsight means that obviousness should be analysed based on the prior art without any\\nknowledge of the invention. So, when you look at the steel wire you have no knowledge\\nof the paper clip. So, that is the way in which you can eliminate hindsight and the\\nproblem solution approach because a problem solution approach involves looking at the\\n 135  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 138}), Document(page_content='problem to be solved it helps you to avoid the hindsight issue.\\n(Refer Slide Time: 22:21)\\nWe just saw that one of the ways in which we can determine inventive step is by the\\nproblem and solution approach, there is another approach which is been recognised by\\nthe Indian courts this is called the windsurfing approach now this was developed in a\\ncase called windsurfing international versus tabor marine. Now in this approach there are\\nfour steps which kind of overlaps with what we had seen in the problem and solution\\napproach the first thing would be to identify the person skilled in the art. The first step is\\nto identify and the person skilled in the art is a notional person is not a real person first\\nyou identify the person skilled in the art and you identify the relevant common general\\nknowledge of that person. The common general knowledge is a term that is used to\\ndescribe the knowledge that is attributable to a person skilled in the art it need not be\\nknowledge that is documented it can be knowledge which is known to that person or\\nknown to the people in that field.\\nSo, the first step is to identify the person skilled in the art and to identify the relevant\\ncommon general knowledge that is attributable to him to identify the inventive concept\\nof the claim in question what is the inventive concept in the claim the first step was to\\nidentify the person skilled in the art and the knowledge attributable to whom. Now you\\n 136  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 139}), Document(page_content='come to the patent application and look at the claim and try to understand; what is the\\ninventive concept in the claim, what is it that the claim covers for which the protection is\\nclaimed the inventive concept.\\nThe third step identify what differences exist between the matter cited as prior art or state\\nof the art and the inventive concept now here comes in the early approach we saw that\\nthe closest prior art was identified then the problem was identified in this case, because\\nthe person skilled in the art is already identified and the knowledge is attributed to him\\nwe look at what forms the state of the art, because state of the art is determined through\\nthe person skilled in the art we look at what forms the state of the art or we identify the\\nstate of the art, and see the difference between the state of the art and the claimed\\ninvention for the inventive concept.\\nSo, the third step will be now that the person skilled in the art is identified and the\\ninventive concept has been construed or constructed we see the difference between these\\ntwo things there is prior art and the inventive concept in the earlier analysis there was the\\nclosest prior art and the problem to be solved. And then you had the invention itself. So,\\nonce you do this that is a third step you will identify some difference between the prior\\nart and the inventive concept there is some difference between these two things the\\nfourth step.\\nAnd the last step will be viewed without any knowledge of the alleged invention as\\nclaimed which is removing hindsight do the difference constitutes steps that would be\\nobvious to a person skilled in the art. Now this was the last step even in the problem and\\nsolution approach whether the step or the movement from the prior art to the invention\\nwould have been possible for a person skilled in the art it would have been possible for\\nthe person skilled in the art, and then we would say the invention is obvious. If it would\\nnot have been possible then we would say it involves an inventive step.\\nSo, the last part of the analysis is the same to see whether from the prior art you could\\nreach the invention the journey from the prior to the invention if the journey from the\\nprior to the invention is obvious then there is no inventive step. If that journey is not\\nobvious a person skilled in the art would not do it then we will say that the invention\\n 137  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 140}), Document(page_content='involves an inventive step. So, the windsurfer test or the windsurfing test has four steps\\nand it involves starting with identifying the person skilled in the art. And the knowledge\\nattributable to him cuts to it involves constructing the claim identifying the inventive\\nconcept then identifying the difference between the prior art and inventive concept and\\nseeing whether it would have been obvious to a person to make that journey to how to\\ntake that step.\\nSo, in a sense any inventive step analysis would involve understanding the invention per\\nse the inventive concept identifying the prior art that is the second step and seeing\\nwhether the movement or the journey from the prior art could have been done by a\\nperson and would it have been obvious to that person. So, we bring the obviousness\\nelement if it would have been obvious there is no inventive step if it has not been\\nobvious then they would be inventive step.\\nThe date of assessment of the inventive step is from the priority date.

So, 9(1) tells us if provisional application is filed it has to\\nbe followed by a complete specification. 9(1) tells us that if a provisional specification is\\nfiled it has to be followed by a complete specification within one year.\\nIf it is not followed by a complete specification then the application will be treated as\\nabundant deemed to be abundant. 9(2) says where 2 or more applications in the name of\\nthe same applicant are accompanied by provisional specifications in respect of inventions\\nwhich are cognate or of which one is the modification of other, and the controller of the\\nopinion that the whole of such invention are such as to constitute a single invention and\\nmay properly be included in one patent, he may allow one complete specification to be\\nfiled in respect of all such provisional specifications, provided that the period of time\\nspecified in sub section one shall be taken from the date of filing the earliest provisional\\nspecification.\\nThere has to be a cross reference to this to section 10(5). 10(5) again talks about the\\nconcept of the single inventive concept or the fact that the invention constitute a single\\ninvention 10(5) this provision tells us that there could be if there are many provisional\\nspecifications filed by the same applicant covering a related aspect of an invention, say\\nthere is a mechanical device which is the combination of many devices and it can do a\\nparticular function a provision is filed for that.\\nThere is an another functionality after a few months the applicant files another provision\\nfor the same device or same combination of devices another functionality.

Before December 31st the applicant\\ncan file one complete specification covering all the aspects covered in the provisional\\nfiled over the period of 12 months, and it will be allowed by the controller provided they\\nare all cognate they are all related. Now this gives the flexibility for the applicant to file\\nmultiple provisional as and when he comes up with his invention or he discovers that\\nthere is a new aspect to this invention and follow it up with the single complete.\\nThe advantage of this provision is that as and when you come up with the discovery you\\ncan disclose it and you have priority and this is a concept which we will discuss in great\\ndetail later, the priority will be ascribe to the date on which the particular provisional was\\nfiled. So, if an aspect of the invention was it is closed on January first by a provisional\\nspecification, then that disclosure when it becomes a claim in soon we will mention in a\\ndetail  the  difference  between  claiming  and a  disclosure  that  claim  in the  complete\\nspecification  will  get  the  priority  from  the  January  first  provisional  specification.\\nAnother  aspect  of  the  invention  which  was  disclosed  on  February  first  by  another\\nprovisional specification if there is a claim that comes through that, then that claim will\\nhave the priority from February first because that was when that aspect of the invention\\nwas first disclosed.\\nSo, the priority is based on the first disclosure and the priority can result in the disclosure\\nbeing formulated as a claim.

So, the claims have to be\\non a separate page and form 2 expressly mentions that claims need not to be applicable\\nfor a provisional specification. So, we understand a provisional as description of an\\ninvention because a descriptive part in class 4 is still necessary, a description of an\\ninvention without the claims, whereas a complete should necessarily have the claims.\\nWhile  section  (9)  deals  with  the  different  instances  where  a  provisional  has  to  be\\nfollowed by a complete, section (10) deals with the contents of the specification; what\\nshould  a  specification  contain?  Section  10(1)  says  that  every  specification  whether\\nprovisional  or  complete  shall  describe  the  invention  and  shall  begin  with  the  title\\nsufficiently indicating the subject matter to which the invention relate. So, there has to be\\na description and a title.\\n 158  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 161}), Document(page_content='In rule 13 the extent of the title is mentioned and what format should be and what should\\nbe the limitations of a title or mentioned in rule 13, we will look at it in a minute. 10(2)\\nstates that subject to any rules that maybe made on this behalf under this act and the\\nrelevant rule being mentioned their rule 13 is a relevant rule, drawings may and shall if\\nthe controller  so requires we supplied for the purpose of any specification whether\\ncomplete  or  provisional  and  any  drawings  are  supplied  shall  unless  the  controller\\notherwise directs be deemed to be a part of the specification and references to this act to\\na specification shall be constitute accordingly. So, this provision says that drawings may\\nbe supplied or if the controller insists, they shall be supplied. So, its optional supplying a\\ndrawing is an optional thing, but if the controller requires then it has to be done.\\nIn most mechanical patents you will find that there are drawings which explain the\\nworking or there is a blown-up view, there are different kinds of drawing or a cross\\nsection which gives an insight into how the invention works. Drawings are treated as a\\npart of a specification and wherever there are references to the drawing you will find that\\nthe written part of this specification will have cross references to the drawing, and\\ndrawings  shall be used to since they form a part of this specification  they will  be\\nregarded in construing the specification. \\nSo, we understand this specification as a written statement of the invention, but the\\nwritten statement can also be supplemented by drawings. 10(3) talks about models and\\nsamples, the controller has the power to insist on a model or a sample of anything\\nillustrating the invention and once the controller insists the applicant shall furnish before\\nthe application is found in order for the grant, but such model or sample shall not be\\ndeemed to be form a part of the specification.\\n 159  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 162}), Document(page_content='(Refer Slide Time: 04:58)\\nNow this is the critical difference between the drawing and a model or a sample, the\\ndrawing is deemed to be a part of the specification which means if you search for a copy\\nof the specification you will find the drawings in it whereas, models and samples by their\\nvery nature they cannot be textualized. So, understand that the drawing and the written\\npart  of  the  specification  because  they  can  be  textualized,  they  form  a  part  of  the\\nspecification. Whereas models and samples it is hard to textualize them so they are not\\ndeemed to be a part of the specification. A model or a sample is not insisted by the\\ncontroller in all the cases, but in some specific cases for instance, if the applicant claims\\nto have invented a machine that is capable of perpetual motion, the controller can insist\\non a working sample so the working sample or a miniature model would show whether\\nthe invention is capable of achieving what the inventor claims.\\nNow, 10(4) describes the various paths and functions of a complete specification. (4)(a)\\nTells us that the complete specification shall fully and particularly describe the invention\\nand its operation and use and the method by which it is to be performed. So, there is a\\nfull description of the invention and operation or use is described and the method by\\nwhich it is performed. So, the working to put it in a nutshell the entire working of the\\ninvention  has  to  be  described  in  the  complete  specification.  (b)  The  complete\\nspecification has to disclose the best method of performing the invention which is known\\nto the applicant and for which he is entitled to claim protection. So, not only should the\\ninvention  be  described  its  working  shown,  but  the  best  method  of  performing  the\\n 160  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 163}), Document(page_content='invention should also be disclosed. (c) The complete specification should end with the\\nclaim or claims defining the scope of the invention for which protection is claimed. So,\\nthe claims should ideally come at the end of the complete specification and they should\\ndefine the scope of the invention for which protection is claimed. \\nSo, this provision tells us that it is the claims that are enforced and it is the claims that\\nare protected. So, when a patentee files a suite after the grant of the patent, it is the\\nclaims that he is going to enforce against the infringer. The person who infringes either\\nthe product or an act of the infringer will now be mapped on to the claim of the patentee,\\nwhatever the patentee has claimed. Only if the product or the act of the infringer falls\\nwithin the scope of the invention as mentioned in the claim will infringement be proved.\\nSo, claims are the most important part of the specification, claims define the scope of the\\ninvention and it is the claims that are granted which can be enforced before a court of\\nlaw.\\nSo, the descriptive part will help us to understand what is being claimed and there are\\ncertain relations that the descriptive part has with the claim. For instance, the claim has\\nto be fairly based on what is described. So, you cannot claim something which you have\\nnot described. So, there are some relationship between these parts, but the claims are\\ndefining part of the invention, the invention is defined in the claim and the path that is\\nenforced by a court of law is the claim and when the patent office grants the claim the\\npatent office is granting protection to the invention in the form of the claim. (d) Mentions\\nthat the complete specification shall be accompanied by an abstract to provide technical\\ninformation on the invention. Now, what should be there in the abstract is detailed in rule\\n13.\\n 161  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 164}), Document(page_content='(Refer Slide Time: 09:42)\\nThe controller has the power to amend the abstract, if the information provided in the\\nabstract is not clear or if the controller feels that by amending the abstract the better\\ninformation will be communicated to third parties. The abstract is one of the parts in the\\nspecification which would be the subject matter of an initial search. Now, when the\\npatent application is published the details of the publication does not have the entire\\nspecification, the complete specification in its entity is not published in the official\\njournal of the patent office, but the bibliographical details  of the invention and the\\nabstract is published in the official journal. \\nSo, the abstract contains  the technical  information  about the invention  and because\\nabstract is published earlier in time there are certain limitations on what you can mention\\nand there are certain word limits on the abstract. So, the abstract is probably we can\\nregard the abstract as the part of the patent specification which is searched first and if the\\nabstract is of supplies information on a particular field of technology, then the person\\nwho  is  searching  may  look  into  the  complete  specification.  Now  in  the  complete\\nspecification where and applicants mentions biological material and if the biological\\nmaterial is not described in a satisfactory manner and if such material is not available to\\nthe public, then the applicant shall deposit the material to an international depositary\\nauthority under the Budapest treaty. \\n 162  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 165}), Document(page_content='This is a requirement which steps in only in the case of biological material that is used.\\nThe requirements are if the biological material is not described in a way in which it\\nsatisfies classes a and b and the biological material is not available to the public, these\\nare the 2 conditions one it is not described in a way which described in classes a and b\\nthat is where the detail a full description of the particulars and best method of working\\nand if the material is not available to the public then there is an obligation on the\\napplicant to deposit the material to an international depositary under the Budapest treaty.\\nNow, the deposit of the material shall be made not later than the date of filing the patent\\napplication in India and reference they too shall be made in the specifications within the\\nprescribed period. So, not only there is a timeline for making the deposit reference also\\nhas  to  be  made  in  the  specification  within  the  prescribed  period  which  is  again\\nmentioned in rule 13. There are some requirements as the specifications shall include the\\nname address of the depository institutions and the date and the number of deposits of\\nthe material at that institution. \\nSo, once the biological material is deposited there is a date on which that is done and a\\nnumber which is given so those details have to be included in the specification and\\naccess to the material is available in the depository institutions only after the date of the\\napplications for patent in India or of the priority date is claimed after the date of priority.\\nSo, the access if anyone needs to access this material that is allowed only after the date\\nof application of the patent or after the date of priority, and the applicant also has to\\ndisclose the source and geographical origin of the biological material in the specification\\nwhen used in an invention. So, if it is a plant variety which grows only in a particular\\ncountry, then the applicant will mention the source from which the biological material\\nwas derived and it will also mention the geographical location.\\n 163  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 166}), Document(page_content='(Refer Slide Time: 13:33)\\n (4A) tell us that in the case of an international application designating India which\\nincludes a convention application and a PCT, the title description drawing abstract and\\nclaims  filed with the application  shall be taken as a complete  specification  for the\\npurposes  of  this  act.  Now  (4A)  actually  tells  us  what  are  the  critical  parts  of  a\\nspecification or what comprises a complete specification title, description, drawings if\\nthere are any, abstract and claims. \\nSo, these 5 parts comprises the complete specification. So, the complete specification\\nwill have a title followed by a description, and the description will have cross references\\nto the drawings if there are any drawings and the drawings will also be there in the\\ncomplete specification in separate sheets, there will be an abstract of the invention again\\nin a separate sheet and claims beginning in a separate sheet. So, these parts together form\\nthe  complete  specification.  Sub-section  10(5)  states  that  the  claim  or  claims  of  a\\ncomplete specification shall relate to us single invention, we had seen this in section (7)\\nthat there is a cross reference to section (7), which tells us that an application can be only\\nfor a single invention. So, they can only be one invention.\\nSo, this re iterates that claim shall or the group of claims shall relate to a single invention\\nor a group of invention linked so as to follow form a single inventive concept. So, this is\\ncalled the unity of invention. An application should pertain to only one invention or a\\ngroup of inventions that are connected by what is called a single inventive concept, there\\n 164  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 167}), Document(page_content='are a group of inventions, but they together have the same concept. 5 also has another\\nrequirement that the complete specifications shall be clear and succinct and shall be\\nfairly  based  on  the  matter  disclosed  the  specification.  The  fact  that  the  complete\\nspecification  should  be  clear  and  succinct  is  a  requirement  that  the  complete\\nspecifications should not be ambiguous and it should communicate the invention clearly.\\nSo, if there is any ambiguity or is there are words that are not clear or words that are\\ncapable of multiple meanings words that are ambiguous or wage, then those can actually\\ncome in the way of the grant of a patent. So, the fact that the patent is granted employees\\nthat the patent clearly and succinctly communicates the invention. Apart from the fact\\nthat  the  claims  of  a  complete  specification  shall  be  clear  and  succinct  clear  and\\nsuccinctness is requirement for the claims, the claim shall also be fairly based on the\\nmatter disclosed in the specification, this concept is called as fair basis which states that\\nthe claims are based on what the matter that is been disclosed in the specification. \\nThis requirement is critical because a person cannot make a claim of something that he\\nhas not disclosed. If the applicant has not disclosed a part of the invention then it would\\nnot be proper on him to claim it without making a disclosure, because as we have already\\nseen in classes a and b of section (10)(1) that the descriptive part has to be full and\\nparticular description, it has to disclose the best method of working the operation or use\\nand the method by which it is performed all these things has to be described in the\\ncomplete specification. \\nSo, if the descriptive path does not make a full description of the invention and if you\\nclaim something which you have not described, then the patent office will regard that\\nyour claims are not fairly based on the matter disclosed and that will be a ground for\\nrejection of the claims. Now we can understand this that if you make a prayer or a\\npetition before an authority or a court of law, normally your petition will end with a set\\nof prayers on relief that you seek at the court of law if it is a relief against trespass into\\nyour property then you  would claim a relief of injunction injecting the person that\\ntrespasses from entering into your property. Now you are not going to make this claim\\nyou are not going to seek this relief of injecting the third party against whom you have\\nfiled a suit from entering your land without describing an instance of trespass or at least\\ndescribing an instance where there is been a threat to trespass into your land. So, the\\n 165  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 168}), Document(page_content='relief that you claim the prayer that you make in your petition has to flow from what you\\nhave pleaded in your petition.\\nSo, if you make a prayer without the corresponding pleading, most likely the court will\\nnot grant you the relief. Similarly, you cannot claim and invention or a part of invention\\nwhich  you  have now  described in  the descriptive  part of the  specification.  So, the\\nconcept of fair basis tells us that every claim should be based on a description in the\\ndescriptive part of the specification; the description should disclose the claim or the\\nclaim should flow from the description. Now this has also led to certain techniques and\\npatent drafting, to ensure that you do not claim something which is not fairly based.\\nSome attorneys draft the descriptive part first and then they try to map it with the claims\\nor the attorneys who draft the claims first that is another approach in patent drafting will\\nensure that a descriptive part has the objects that have been claimed described in details. \\nSo, either way whether you follow the method of put asking the description first and\\ncarving out the claims or drafting the claims first and working back on the description in\\neither way you are going to ensure that the claims are based on the description to get\\nover this objection that which would come from the patent office, in case if the claims\\nare not fairly based on the description. Sub section (6) says that the declaration as to\\ninventorship of the invention shall in such cases as may be prescribed be furnished in the\\nprescribed  form  with  the  complete  specification  or  within  such  period  as  may  be\\nprescribed after the filing of that specification. \\nNow we saw this the proof of write in the case of an assignment could be filed either at\\nthe time of filing the complete specification at the time of making the application or after\\na time period that is prescribed and we saw that the time period that was prescribed was\\n6 months from the date of filing the specification. So, there was an option. So, there are\\ndocuments that go along with the form 1 and form 2 and if you look at the form 1 the\\nconcluding part of form 1 tells you what are the documents that has to be accompanied\\nalong with the form 1. Form 2 in all cases is accompanied accompanies the form 1 and\\nthe declaration of inventorship should also accompanied the form 1.\\nIf it is not filed along with the complete specification then it has to be filed within the\\nperiod that is prescribed. Now a declaration of inventorship is filed using form 5, there is\\na separate form for that now the prescribed time period we look at it when we come to\\n 166  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 169}), Document(page_content='rule 13. Subsection (7) states that subject to the following provisions of this section a\\ncomplete specification filed after the provisional specification may include claims in\\nrespect  of  developments  or  additions  to  the  invention  which  was  described  in  the\\nprovisional specification being development or additions in respect of which they have\\napplicant  would be entitled  under the  provisions  of section  (6) to make  a separate\\napplication for a patent. Sub section (7) says that if there is a complete specification filed\\nafter a provisional then all the developments and additions that happen to the invention\\nin the interregnum, in the period between the filing of the provisional and the complete\\ncan also be claimed in the complete. \\nSo, there is no need for the applicant to file a separate application for that though he\\nwould be entitled to do it, but since there is time period between the provisional and the\\ncomplete, all the development that happened after the filing of the provisional could also\\nbe included in the claims  of the complete. Without doubt those claims  which were\\nincluded later on will have a different priority date, and we had mentioned that claims\\nwill have different priority and the priority date of the claim the date on which the claims\\nare filed for the first time or disclose to the world for the first time, the priority date will\\nstart from the date on which the disclosure was first made. \\nSo, if the part of the claim filed with the complete specification was disclosed in a\\nprovisional then the date of the provisional will be the priority date for that claim. If that\\nclaim  was  filed  only  in  the  complete  and  it  was  not  disclosed  in  the  provisional,\\nassuming that there is a description that goes with the claim in the complete then the date\\nwill be of that of the complete.\\nTo give  you  a  better  illustration  if  the  provisional  was  filed  on  January first  of  a\\nparticular year which has a mechanical device, and in June first complete is filed for that\\ninvention with the claims, but when the complete is filed there is also an additional\\ndevice  are  an  additional  component  that  is  added  to  the  invention  which  was  not\\ndescribed in the provisional that was filed in that year then that additional device which\\nwas filed in June will have the priority in June, because it was not disclosed before where\\nas the main device which was disclosed in January, will have its priority from January,\\nthough the claims appeared only in the complete specification that was filed in June.

Section (16) when we come to it pertains to divisional\\napplications, divisional application is where application has more than one invention is\\nclaimed and the patent office either requires the applicant to divide the applications into\\n2 separate inventions or more or the applicant voluntarily divides the invention into 2 or\\nmore applications because there are 2 or more inventions in it. \\nNow in such cases the latter specification will have a cross reference to the specific\\nnumber of the original applications, it is just to show that the divider applications came\\nfrom  an original  application  and  there  has  to  be a  cross  reference  to  that  number.\\nSimilarly, in the case of the patent of addition and the patent of addition is patent for an\\nimprovement that can be filed after the original application is filed. \\nSo, if there is an improvement to an existing invention there is no need for a person to\\nfile a fresh application and file a fresh patent. A patent for addition gives the advantage to\\nthe applicant to just add that additional improvement as a part of an earlier application.\\nNow a patent of addition does the same work or the analogy of a patent of addition could\\nbe  found  in  section  (9)  and  section  (10)  where  it  was  mentioned  if  there  where\\n 169  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 172}), Document(page_content='improvements made to or additions made we specifically saw the language in section\\n10(7), where additions are made after the filing of a provisional specification, those\\nadditions to the invention could be captured in the complete specification.

So, any improvement or addition made to the invention could still be\\ncaptured in the complete specification so far as it pertains to the same invention what\\nhappens if the patent applies the complete specification is filed?

So, 2 to 8 are dependent claims because there is a\\ncross reference to an earlier claim, claim 1 is an independent claim.\\nSo, claims broadly fall into 2 categories, the idea between a dependent claim and in an\\nindependent claim is that independent claims can stand on their own. If a dependent\\nclaim that is attach to an independent claim is attacked for lack of inventiveness or lack\\nof novelty, then the dependent claim alone can be revoked or nullified. Whereas, if the\\nattack is on the independent claim itself. So, in that the independent claim does not have\\nnovelty it lacks novelty or it lacks inventive step, then the independent claim will be\\nrevoked and the reason the independent claim is revoked all the dependent claims will\\nalso have to be revoked.

We had seen format which\\nis in normally filed in the US patent office and we had also seen an Indian patent\\nspecification. Now how we known this structure it should be much more easier for us to\\nread the patent specification because the patent specification is a document that is created\\nby group of people patent attenuation in coordination with the inventor. So, over the US\\nthere are some conventions that have developed as to what can come within a patent\\nspecification, and there are certain techniques or requirements which have to be satisfied\\nwhile drafting these documents. So, let us look at how to read a patent specification and\\nlet us also see; what is the function that the patent specification performs?\\n(Refer Slide Time: 01:20)\\nNow before we look at the patent specification, we have to see that there are certain\\nconcepts in a specification; though the specification is a document we need to understand\\ncertain concepts in patent law, which come in repeatedly in the patent specification and\\n 203  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 206}), Document(page_content='unless we have a good grounding on these concepts it may be very hard for us to\\nunderstand what function is being done by this specification.\\nNow, we divide these concepts as prior art or requirements that a patent specification\\nshould  address  with  regard  to  the  prior  art,  and  internal  requirements.  Internal\\nrequirements are requirements that the patent specification has to address within the\\ndocument itself. So, you can call them external requirements and internal requirements,\\nwe are using the word prior art because prior art is the reference point when it comes to\\nknowledge. So, there is some knowledge that is contained in the patent specification, and\\nthere is the comparison that is being done by the applicant to the prior art, you saw that\\nfield of invention background of the invention these are all instances where the applicant\\nwould bring in some amount of prior art or prior knowledge to say that there was a\\nproblem in some cases as we saw in the combination when, there was a problem in the\\nprior art and the invention solve that problem which is what we call that problem and\\nsolution approach.\\nSo, the prior art there are the patent specification has many concepts and these concepts\\nare established concepts in patent law, which figured within a patent specification. Now\\nlet us look at those concepts  in detail.  Now on prior art first thing that the patent\\nspecification  should  satisfy  his  novelty,  the  claim  drafted  in  the  claim  part  of  the\\nspecification should be novel. Novel means that the invention should be new, what is\\nclaimed has to be new and it should not be anticipated by the prior art. Anticipated means\\nthere is a disclosure and the disclosure completely has all the elements all the integral\\nelements or the technical features that is covered in the claim. If the claim has five\\ntechnical features and the prior art before the claim was filed at disclosure in another\\ndocument before this data filing of the claim.\\nIf the prior art completely mapped all those five technical features, then we will say the\\ninvention is anticipated by the prior art. So, when the invention is anticipated by the prior\\nart, we say there is lack of novelty or there is no novelty. So, novelty is something which\\nhas to be satisfied in this specification itself. So, if you draft a specification which\\noverlaps on a existing prior art, though you may have done a good work in drafting the\\nclaims; if you have not the check with the prior art then there could be a possibility that\\nthe claim that you have drafted all the essential technical features have already being\\ndisclosed in another prior art, and because it was disclosed in another prior art your claim\\n 204  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 207}), Document(page_content='would lack novelty. So, novelty is something which has to be demonstrated in the claim\\npart of the specification, and it has to be compared with the prior art.\\nInventive step: just as novelty has to be satisfied by the claim, the claim should also\\nsatisfy inventive step. An inventive step is much more stringently artistic than novelty\\nbecause in determining an inventive step we looked at the invention from the view point\\nof a person skilled in the art it should not be obvious to a person skilled in the art. So,\\nagain you find that the specification will have to consider the prior art and it has to the\\nclaims have to be drafted in a way it is not obvious to a person skilled in the art.\\nUtility: utility is the fact that the invention is capable of industrial application that in the\\nother word for it is utility. Utility is not a comparison with the prior art, but further to be\\nutility we have to it has to be understood from the use to which the invention can be put\\nto. If the prior art has a particular use you are going to claim that one of the objectives is\\nto use this invention has in different objective which is the prior art did not address or if\\nthe prior art had a problem the use of the invention solves that problem. So, again there\\ncould be some comparison between the prior art in demonstrating utility, utility is also\\ncalled the third requirement which is also known as capable of industrial application.\\nPriority claims when they are filed for them to be valid, they should have a valid priority,\\nvalid priority in the sense that they should not be any prior disclosure before the point on\\nwhich the claim was drafted. So, priority every claim has a priority; we will see that in\\nsection 11 that each claim will have a priority and the priority of a claim can either be\\nreferred back to an earlier document or it can also be priority can also be given up and\\nclaims can be postdated, antedating and postdating we will look at that in greater detail\\nin the forth coming lectures.\\nSo, priority is again to determine priority there has to be if there is a prior art the prior\\ndisclosure before your date of priority, then that could be used as a prior art for in\\nvalidating the invention. So, priority is a concept which is outside the specification, but\\nnever the less in drafting you  will have to consider it. Subject matter: whether the\\nclaimed invention is a subject matter that is excluded or not is going to be a comparison\\nwith something it is going to be an external comparison, for instance there are certain\\nsubject matters that are excluded from being granted a patent a literary or an artistic work\\ncannot be granted a patent.\\n 205  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 208}), Document(page_content='So, that is a subject matter exception and subject matter will determine what kind of\\nprotection you will get. That also a requirement that biological materials have to be\\ndisclosed and there is a requirement for depositing biological material. Now that has to\\nfigure in the complete specification though it is something external if the biological\\nmaterial is available in the public domain, you have to refer it in an identifiable manner\\nor if it is not available then you will have to deposit before a depository. With regard to\\nthe  internal  requirements  there  is  a  concept  called  Enabling  disclosure.  So,  in  the\\ndescriptive part you are going to describe the invention with examples with illustrations,\\ndrawings and showing how the invention works.\\nNow, the standard of disclosure is that the disclosure should enable a person skilled in\\nthe art to come up with the invention, to make the invention. So, there is a particular\\nstandard, you cannot just have a skeletal disclosure or a barred disclosure without getting\\nin to the details, which if a person skilled in the asked reject will not be able to come up\\nwith the invention. So, the disclosure in a patent specification should be of such a\\nstandard that the person skilled in the art who reached the patent specification need not\\ncome back to the dept with any doubt. So, it has to be a complete disclosure and the\\ndisclosure  should  also  enable  the  person  to  come  up  with  the  invention.  So,  the\\ndescriptive  part  will  have  illustrations  if  a  person  skilled  in  the  art  looks  at  those\\nillustrations, he should be able to work the invention as it is described and come up with\\nan invention as a product as an end result. \\nBest method: section 10 requires the disclosure of best method, best method of working\\nthe invention has to be disclosed again it is an internal requirement, enabling disclosure it\\nis an internal requirement, if the disclosure that is done in their specification is not\\nenabling  that  can  be  a  ground  for  revocation.  Similarly, if  the  best  method  is  not\\ndisclosed, it could again be a ground for revoking the patent.\\nDefiniteness: again, it is a requirement under section 10; it requires the claim as it is\\nclaim to be clear and succinct. So, definiteness requires the claim to be clear and succinct\\nthere cannot be ambiguity in the claim, if the claim is ambiguous again it can be a\\nground for rejecting the claim that is an internal requirement.\\nFair basis: again, it is a requirement under section 10 the claims have to be fairly based\\non the matter disclosed.\\n 206  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 209}), Document(page_content='Now, we  had  seen  earlier  that  the  patent  specification  broadly  has  two  parts  the\\ndescriptive part and the claim. So, whatever is claimed in the claims part should be based\\non something that is disclosed in the specification, what the act says section 10 says on\\nthe matter disclosed in the specification. So, the fair basis is requirement that you cannot\\nclaim something which you have not disclosed. So, you should disclose something in the\\ndescriptive part and based on the disclosure you should make a claim. So, if there is a\\nclaim which incorporates an element or a part which is not disclosed or explained in the\\ndescriptive part, then we say the claim is not fairly based on the description.\\nSo, the claims have to come from the description. Now the claim you can one analogy or\\none example that will help you understand the claim is like prayer that you make in a suit\\nthat your file before a court. If you file a complaint or a petition as a petition of before\\nthe court normally you will request for a prayer you will ask the court for a relief the\\nrelief will be in the form of a prayer. If you have a dispute between your neighbor if the\\ndispute pertains to land say your neighbor as encroach on your land. So, your prayer will\\nbe to injunctive to stop him from encroaching and to claim back the land that he has\\nencroached these are going to be the relief that you claim.\\nSo, the prayer or the relief that you claim are going be based on what you have pleaded\\nin your case what you have pleaded in your petition or your complaint. You may not ask\\nfor a relief without giving the factual circumstances for claiming that relief. You cannot\\nask for your neighbor to be arrested because you have not pleaded a case as to what\\nwrong here done for which he should be arrested, because the civil consequences will be\\ndifferent from a criminal case.\\nSo, you cannot ask for any relief that is unconnected to what you have pleaded in your\\npetition or in your complaint. Similarly, you cannot claim something that is unconnected\\nto what you have described in your descriptive part of the invention. So, this is what we\\nsay fair basis; the claim should be fairly based on the matter disclosed in the description.\\nSo, if a claim contains something which is not disclosed in the description that could be a\\nground for invalidation, section 10 also says that an invention should be contained in a\\nsingle application, one application per invention.\\n If  there  are  more  than  one  invention  then  there  has  to  be  a  similar  number  of\\napplications. So, there is a single inventive concept or the fact that each application\\n 207  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 210}), Document(page_content='should only contain one invention. So, if you have multiple inventions and you combine\\nall these multiple inventions in one single application, then the patent office may require\\nyou to divide the application depending on the number of inventions you have included\\nin a single application and perceive them as separate independent applications. So, from\\nthis we understand that there are certain requirements that the specification has to satisfy\\nsome of which are compared with the prior art or what we called external requirements\\nand others are what we called internal requirements.\\n(Refer Slide Time: 14:48)\\nNow, priority is a concept that is type to the length of the patent; length of the patent is\\nthe time during which the patent remains valid and enforceable from the date of the\\napplication  till  the  date  the  patent  expires  is  what  we  called  the  length.  Priority\\ndetermines the length the length of a patent is determined by the priority. So, when you\\nget the priority you start you can determine the length of a patent the time period during\\nwhich it is valid can be ascertained. Each claim has a different priority we will see in\\nsection 11 that the priority for each claim will be different and there can also be cases\\nwhere there are multiple priorities, claims can also have multiple priorities.\\nThe length of a patent is also determined by revocation because normally the patent will\\nbe alive if the patentee raise the renewal fees over a period of time, it would kindly keep\\nalive for 20 years from the date of application. But if 3 is a challenge to the patent and if\\nthe patent gets revoked, then the length of the patent gets shortened.

So, you can see the section and the relevant\\nprovisions. \\nThe  abstract  provides  technical  information  can  be  amended  by  the  controller  is  a\\nconcise summary not more than 150 words, it indicates a technical field a technical\\nadvancement  to  existing  knowledge,  principle  use  and  it  is  used  as  an  efficient\\ninstrument for searching in a particular field.\\n 209  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 212}), Document(page_content='(Refer Slide Time: 17:15)\\nDescription: now the descriptive part of the patent every specification shall describe the\\ninvention, drawing shall be a part of the specification, describe operation use method of\\nperforming  which  shall  disclose  the  best  method  known  to  the  applicant,  and  if\\nbiological  material  is  there then the deposit under the Budapest treaty within three\\nmonths  from the date of filing the application.

In the sense that a professional is filed\\nwhen the inventor feels that the claims are not ready, though the invention may be ready\\nit may not be a time where he can sit and draft a claim, the details of the claims have not\\ncome or he wants to preserve the priority. So, when the invention has reached the stage\\nwhere it can be disclosed in writing that is the point at which the provisional is usually\\nfiled it is filed early.\\n 212  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 215}), Document(page_content='So, that it secures a priority of the invention the provisional is a time bound document, if\\nyou file a provisional you have to file a complete within 12 months.\\n(Refer Slide Time: 01:42)\\nYou could post date a provisional, but you would lose priority if you post dated which\\ncan  happen  within  12 months.  Now  one of the  things  that  you  could  do  with  the\\nprovision list you can file a provisional and if you do not follow it up with complete,\\nthen the provisional is deemed to have been abandoned. The advantage of something\\nbeing abandoned is that it is not published.\\nSo, it does not come into the public domain, but then you abandon you cannot claim the\\npriority of that provisional anymore. The provisional is as though you had withdrawn it\\nfrom the system a copy does not exist for people who want to get a copy it is not\\npublished. So, when it is not published the matter does not fall into the public domain,\\nbut the person who gives up approach specification will also give up the priority. Now\\nprofessionals you could file multiple provisional and we had seen this in section (9), you\\ncould file multiple provisionals and follow it up by one complete specification. If the\\napplications are cognate or they are one is a modification of the other.\\nSo, if there are related applications you could file multiple provisionals and follow it up\\nwith  one  complete  provided  the  complete  is  filed  within  12  months  of  the  first\\napplication?

If you import an\\ninvention into India then if you are the first importer, you will not be regarded as the true\\nand first inventor. Section (48) refers to importation as one of the rights protected by a\\npatent. A patent when it is granted also gives the right to import and invention. So, this\\nvery specifically says true and first inventor is a person who has to do something with\\nthe creation of the invention not merely importing it.\\nSo, mere importation of the invention into India will not make you the true and first\\ninventor.  Similarly,  a  person  to  whom  and  invention  is  communicated  is  first\\ncommunicated from outside India. Now in the earlier occasion the product came into\\nIndia in this category the invention was communicated and you will know the invention\\ncan be communicated in various ways there are communications get can destroy the\\nnovelty of an invention, there are secret communications or protected communications\\nconfidential communications. So, when an invention is first communicated to a person in\\nIndia from outside India even that will not qualify for a true and first inventor.\\n 225  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 228}), Document(page_content='So, that brings us to the question who is the true and first inventor. True and first inventor\\nis the person who conceives and develops the invention. We could also say that he is the\\nperson who puts into practice the invention for the first time if you recall the history of\\npatent law, true and first inventor is a phrase that developed in the United Kingdom and\\nwe  have  cases  to  say  which  describes  how  this  concept  evolved.  An  analogy  in\\nunderstanding the true and first inventor will be the author of a copyrighted work the\\nauthor of a copyrighted work is given a special status in copyright law. He or she is a\\nperson who makes the original work for the first time.\\nSo, the person who makes the invention for the first time is regarded as the true and first\\ninventor. Just as you cannot have a copyrighted work without an author, similarly you\\ncannot have a patented invention without a true and first inventor. So, inventor is the\\nperson who creates the invention and patent law does not recognize and invention which\\ndoes not have an inventor. So, it the explanation to the definition  of true and first\\ninventor actually excluded by mentioning a person who imports for the first time and a\\nperson who communicates for the first time it actually excluded or it did not say anything\\nabout the person who actually created the invention.\\nSo, we understand the true and first inventor as the person who created the invention for\\nthe first time and analogy as I mentioned is the author of a work or written work or a\\nliterary work which can be subject matter of a copyright the author may later on assign\\nhis right of publication to a publisher and the publisher may publisher that book. So,\\neven if there are publishers or even if there is a publisher behind a book, we would\\nnormally expect that book to be authored by a person legal entity. So, in this case when\\nwe find an invention we expect there to be a person or a group of real legal entities\\nbehind them, whom you refer to as a first true and first inventor.\\nIt is possible for the true and first inventor to assign the invention to a third party, and the\\nperson to whom the invention gets assign is call the assignee.

So, if you\\nlook at form one you will find that form one which is the first form in the second\\nschedule, second schedule deals with all the forms you will find in clause 4 of form 1 the\\ninventors have to be mentioned. And in clause 12 which deals with declaration, the first\\ndeclaration is the declaration by the inventors where the inventors would state or declare\\nif there are multiple inventors, we the above-named inventors are the true and first\\ninventors for this invention, and declare that the applicant herein our assignee all legal\\nrepresentative.\\nNow, this tells us that even if there is an assignment of the invention it is necessary for\\nthe inventor to make a declaration that they other true and first inventor. A declaration\\nmade by the true and first inventor may not have any bearing on determining who\\ninvented the invention for the first time, though the phrase refers to it as the true and first\\ninventor, this phrase will not be critical in determining disputes with regard to inventor\\nship for the simple reason that India follows the first to file principal rather than the first\\nto invent principle.\\nIf the united states used to follow the first to invent principal till sometime back, but in\\n2013 they amended the law and now and united states used to be alone exception in that,\\nnow they universally follow what other countries do the way to determine inventor ship\\nis to determine who at first file the invention.

So, that is why you still\\nhave the phrase true and first inventor. So, we just now saw that how the phrase to when\\nfirst inventor is defined in a manner in which it excludes 2 categories of people the\\nperson  who  first  imports  invention  for  the  first  time,  and  the  person  who  first\\ncommunicates the invention into India for the first time from outside India obviously.\\nNow this is the first category of people who can make an application because the section\\n(6) talks about who can make a application for a patent. So, the person who invents the\\ninvention who creates the invention for the first time can file an application for a patent.\\nSo, that is the first category.\\n(Refer Slide Time: 09:19)\\nThe second category is mentioned in 6(1)(b) by any person being the assignee of a\\nperson claiming to be the true and first inventor in respect of the right to make such an\\napplication.\\n 228  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 231}), Document(page_content='(Refer Slide Time: 09:34)\\nSo, the second category is a person being an assignee of the true and first inventor. So,\\nthe right to make an application comes from the true and first inventor, because this\\ncategory says that if the true and first inventor assigns the right in an invention then the\\nassignee can step in as the applicant. So, we understand that there are 2 categories of\\npeople to whom an invention can be related to. The first category as a true and first\\ninventor who is the maker of the invention and the second category is the applicant who\\ncan apply. So, the person who makes the invention need not be the applicant in all the\\ncases. In 6(1)(a), the person who is the true and first inventor the inventor can actually be\\nthe applicant, but in most cases the applicant will be the assignee.\\nFor instance, if a person works for an institution a research institution. The scientist who\\nworks in the research institution will be regarded as a true and first inventor of the\\ninvention, but most likely the patent will be filed in the name of the research institution\\nitself. So, the research institution will be the applicant and the scientist who came up\\nwith the invention will be shown as the true and first inventor. Now the right to make the\\napplication by the research institution will be through an assignment. So, the true and\\nfirst  inventor  either  through  the  employment  contract  or  by  through  some  special\\narrangement, will have to assign the right in the invention to the assignee that is the\\nresearch institution for the research institution to make an application.

Rule 10 states where\\nin an application for a pattern made by virtue of an assignment of a right to apply for a\\npatent for an invention, if the proof of right to make the application is not furnished with\\nthe  application,  the  applicant  shall  within  the  period  of 6  months  after  filing  such\\napplication furnished such proof.

How do you compute the 6 months in the case\\nof international application as mentioned in the explanation?\\nThe proof of right in a normal case will be an assignment deed if you do not call it an\\nassignment deed, but it is any document that shows the assignee has derived the right to\\nmake the application on behalf of the or from the true and first inventor. It could be a\\nspecial assignment deed, it could be the terms of employment between the true and first\\ninventor and the assignee if the assignee, is the employer of the inventor it could be a\\nformal letter saying that I assign. So, any kind of proof the act and the rules do not\\ndescribe or do not specify a particular kind of an assignment deed or a particular kind of\\nan assignment, it just says you just need to produce the proof of right.\\nHow is that you are making this application when you are not the inventor. So, any\\nassignee who makes an application needs to show that he has a proof of right and the\\nproof of right could be an assignment deed, could be an employment contract, could be\\nsome kind of an instrument through which they can demonstrate that the true and first\\ninventor has assigned the right to make the application.

So, name to be the true and first\\ninventor.\\nNow, all these details you can find in form 1. Now just largely described certain things\\nthat are contained in form 1; there is a requirement that the applicant who makes the\\napplication has to show that the applicant is not possession of the invention. This is the\\nconcept to show that the invention was in a form or the invention at attend the one way\\nto explain this is to the concept of possession of the invention is required by law to\\nensure that the invention was in a form in which it could be put to practice, that is one\\nexplanation. The other explanation is to show that the person who made the application\\nwas actually incomplete possession and control of the invention.\\nSo, there was no possible ownership disputes that could arise because the person at made\\na declaration that they are in possession. So, this could be understood in 2 ways. So, if\\nyou look at form 1 again clause 12 on declarations, sub clause 3 declaration by the\\napplicant the first declaration is I’m/We or in possession of the above-named invention.\\nSo, there is a declaration on possession of the invention that the applicant; it is just not\\nthe inventor the applicant needs to make because the law assumes that you can make an\\napplication only if you  possess the invention. Now, we may not conceive this as a\\nphysical possession of the invention, this is the possession which enables or gives the\\nperson the right to make an application.\\nSo, this declaration is required this is not something which applicants worry about, this is\\nvery not a controversial provision at all, but nevertheless this as remained in our act that\\nan applicant who makes application for patent needs to make a statement that he or she is\\nin possession of the invention. Then the second requirement on the on the subsection 3 is\\nthat the true and first inventor needs to be mentioned the name of the person claiming to\\nbe the true and first may inventor has to be mentioned; again this is a requirement in\\nclause 4 of form 1 and where the true and first inventor is not the applicant or is not one\\nof the applicants or not making the application and we discuss this earlier the status of an\\ninventor is different from the status of an applicant.\\nSo, in form 1 you will find there is a column where you need to mention the inventors,\\nthere is also a column where you give the details as an applicant you sign as an applicant\\nthe declaration made as an applicant. If you see clause 12 on declaration, there is a\\n 235  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 238}), Document(page_content='separate  declaration  made  by the inventors  and a separate declaration  made  by the\\napplicant. So, the status of an inventor is different from the status of an applicant the\\ninventor in some cases could be the applicant, but it is not necessary that in all cases the\\ninventors has to be the applicant 2. So, where the inventor is not the applicant, then the\\napplication shall contain a declaration that the applicant believes the persons who name\\nto be the inventor or the first inventor believes the persons who name to be the true and\\nfirst inventor.\\nClause 4 of form 1 covers both the categories of inventors; inventors who are applicants\\nand inventors who need not be the applicant. So, in cases where the inventors are the\\napplicant, they have to show that they are also applying in the status of an applicant. In\\nclause 4 there is also a column with says if no furnished the details of the inventors. So,\\nwhere the inventors are not applying for the patent, say the patent is being applied by an\\nassignee then the details of the inventors need to be mentioned in clause 4.\\n(Refer Slide Time: 12:52)\\nSo, the part of the form 1 which has a reference to 7(3) is clause 4. 7(4) talks about the\\nform 7(4) talks about what should accompany and application when a patent is 5.\\nSo, the rule in patent law is that form 1 has to be filed along with form 2. Form 1 is the\\nform that is used for making an application for grant of a patent, and form 2 is the form\\nthat is used for a provisional or a complete specification. Patent specification is the\\ndocument that encompasses or describes the invention there is the whole lot of parts in a\\n 236  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 239}), Document(page_content='patent specification, the patent specification describes the invention and it ends with one\\nor more claims it has a title there is an abstract.\\nSo, the formal document that encompasses the invention for which a patent is sort for, is\\nwhat  we  call  the  patent  specification  and  the  patent  specification  can  either  be  a\\nprovisional or a complete. Now here in 7(4) it is mentioned that every such application\\nnot  being  a  convention  application  or  an  application  filed  under  the  PCT  patent\\ncooperation  treaty does  not dating  India.  So, these  2 are the  kinds  of international\\napplications and international application can either be a convention application or can\\nbe an application under the PCT for patent cooperation treaty. Except for these 2 every\\nsuch application  shall be accompanied  by a provisional  or a complete  specification\\nwhich is what I mentioned as a rule you cannot file form 1 without form 2, or form 1\\nshould always be filed along with form 2.\\nSo, if you prefer an application for a patent, it is essential that you have a copy of the\\nprovisional or the complete specification and to file the provisional or the complete\\nspecification you need to use form 2. Why is this exception made, why is inverted in this\\nfashion? The section could have said every such application shall be accompanied by a\\ncomplete specification why provisional or complete. The reason for this can be found in\\nsection 136(1)(a) which talk about convention application, it is mentioned that every\\nconvention application shall be accompanied by a complete specification. So, you cannot\\nfile  a convention  application  based on a provisional.  So, that  is  why a  convention\\napplication and the same rule apply for PCT, the convention application and a PCT when\\nit is applied it can only be done with complete specification.\\nSo, the  cross  reference  to  this  part  of the section  is  136(1)(a). Since  a convention\\napplication  and  a  PCT  application  cannot  be  filed  by  up  by  filing  a  provisional\\nspecification those 2 things are exempted here. So, you will understand the full import of\\n7(4)  by  looking  at  136(1)(a)  and  136(1)(a)  clearly  mentions  for  an  international\\napplication which includes a convention and a PCT application it shall be accompanied\\nby a complete specification.\\nSo, you cannot file those applications by a provisional by or by using a provisional.\\nWhere as in India if you are preferring an application in India alone, what we call an\\napplication at domestic application or a local application filed in India alone, then you\\n 237  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 240}), Document(page_content='could have a provisional filing that the form 2 can contain a provisional and still your\\napplication will be taken into account. So, 7(4) talks about 2 types of application; 7(4)\\ntalks about 2 kinds of specifications that can be used, and 7(4) very clearly says that if\\nyou are filing a convention application or a PCT then compulsory specific at the then\\ncomplete specification is mandatory.\\n(Refer Slide Time: 17:07)\\nSection 7 which deals with form of application gives us a rough idea about kinds of\\napplication, now we understand that there is an Indian application which you can make\\nfor which you will get a grant in India where the patent is granted, and there are also 2\\ntypes of international applications that can be made; one is the convention application\\nand the other is the PCT or the patent cooperation treaty and application made under the\\npatent cooperation treaty.\\nWe also understand that the requirements for filing these 2 applications are different. You\\ncould  file  an  Indian  application  based  on  a  provisional  where  as  an  international\\napplication cannot be file based on a provisional specification it as always it should\\nalways be accompanied by a complete specification and we will come to the details\\nabout what a provisional is and what a complete specification is we will discuss those\\ndetails in section 9. Now we can rough understanding of how the patent system works;\\nsection 6 talked about who are the applicants who are the people who can apply then 7\\n 238  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 241}), Document(page_content='tells us about the forms to be used and we saw that form 1 has to be used along with\\nform 2, section 6 tells us about the persons and section 7 tells us about the procedure.\\nNow, what these 2 provisions are silent about is the fact that with the applications will be\\nfiled in a patent office and soon after filing them the patent office will have it is own\\nprocedure to follow in accumulating these applications. You find some detail in rule\\neleven order of recording applications. Now once the application is filed then the patent\\nof his needs to record those applications in the order in which it received it. So, order 11\\ntells us that the applications filed in a year shall constitute a series identified by the year\\nof such filing. In case of an application file corresponding to an international application\\nin which India is designated, such applications have constitute a series distinct from the\\nrest of the application identified by the year of filing of the corresponding applications in\\nIndia  which  simply  means  that  if  you  file  an  Indian  application  it  gets  numbers\\nsequentially based on the year, but if it is a foreign application or an international\\napplication the numbering is different. Now we will show you some instances we will\\ntake you through the website and show you how this works section 8 information and\\nundertaking regarding foreign applications.\\n(Refer Slide Time: 19:32)\\nNow  section  8  is  applicable  only  in  instances  where  an  applicant  who  makes  an\\napplication in India, also files an application in a country outside India that is a foreign\\napplication in respect of something which is similar to the invention or substantially the\\n 239  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 242}), Document(page_content='same, it has to be the same invention or slight modification largely the invention is the\\nsame. So, if the invention is same and if an application has been filed in India if there are\\nany corresponding foreign applications, there is a duty cast on the applicant to furnish\\nsome information with regard to foreign application.\\nSo, section 8 will apply only in cases where there are corresponding foreign application\\nis filed, it will not apply in a case where a person prefers Indian application alone. So, it\\nwill not apply in those cases. Now why is this provision there? One of the reasons for\\nthis provision is that not all patent offices have some duty to cooperate with the each\\nother or do they have an arrangement where they can share information filed by different\\napplicants  before  them.  For  instance,  the  Indian  patent  office  will  not  have  any\\narrangement with the Japanese patent office or the European patent office, to understand\\nwho is filing what invention and to disclose that; obviously, many of the filings once\\nthey get published  get into the public domain,  but there is no duty of cooperation\\nbetween the patent offices.\\nSo, in such cases the duty to share information about a pending foreign application is\\ncasted on the applicant. Now why should the applicant disclose, this why cannot the\\napplicant just file an application in India; prosecuted and not disclose this to the patent\\noffice as to what is happening to is other application which you would have filed in other\\njurisdictions. One reason behind this provision is that at the patent office needs to be kept\\ninformed  as  to  what  is  happening  in  other  jurisdictions  with  regard  to  the  same\\napplication. It does not mean that the patent office will follow a decision taken by\\nanother patent office or in another country or it will be or the in the decision whether to\\ngrant or reject the application will be influenced by the decision of another patent office,\\nit merely means that there is a duty casted on the applicant to share information on what\\nhas happened to his other applications, which are substantially the same. \\nSection 8 reads section 8 subsection 1 where an applicant is for a patterned under this act\\nis  prosecuting  either  alone  or  jointly  with other  person  with  any other  person  and\\napplication  for  a  patent  in  any  country  outside  India  in  respect  of  the  same  or\\nsubstantially the same invention. So, the invention can be same or it could also be\\nsubstantially the same because you will know that patents are ever granted in the manner\\nin which they are applied for; in very rare cases they are granted in the way in which\\nthey are applied for. Prosecution or this scrutiny by the patent office will require the\\n 240  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 243}), Document(page_content='applicant to make some changes to give up certain things to narrow down the scope of\\ninvention and all these things could happen based on the objections raised by the patent\\noffice and patent offices because they do not co operate and work with each other their\\nobjection is that a patent office would raise on a same invention can substantially vary\\nfrom one patent office to another.\\nSo, then end result of an invention that is granted based on the same patent application\\nwould  look  different  in  different  jurisdictions.  For  instance,  in  India  a  method  of\\ntreatment cannot be the subject matter of a patent. So, if there is a claim on a method of\\ntreatment most likely that will be struck off by the Indian patent office whereas, claim for\\na method of treatment may get granted in by the United States and it could be one of the\\nclaims that is covered for the invention.\\nSo, even though the method of treatment is just one of the many claims in that invention,\\nit will still be regarded as substantially the same invention, though the corresponding\\napplication in India may not have the method of treatment claim. So, that is why the\\nwording  in  section  8  refers  to  not  only  the  same  invention,  but  it  also  refers  to\\nsubstantially the same meaning which even a small change has occurred in the course of\\nprosecution or even before filing the applications, still it will be regarded as the same\\ninvention.\\n(Refer Slide Time: 24:40)\\n 241  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 244}), Document(page_content='Section  8(1)  continuous  or  where  to  his  knowledge  such  an  application  is  being\\nprosecuted by some person through whom he claims or by some person deriving title\\nfrom him he shall file along with this application or subsequently within the prescribed\\ntime as a controller may allow. So, it is not necessary that the applicant should be\\nprosecuting the application, it could be somebody who claims through him still there is a\\nduty cast on the applicant to give the following information. Now this could be filed the\\ninformation that is required could be filed along with the application that is an option\\ngiven to the applicant or subsequently within the period prescribed. And we are already\\nmentioned this wherever you find this term period prescribed time, prescribed form,\\nprescribed then the details are most likely to be in the rules.\\nSo, we will get to the corresponding rule soon, now what is the information that is\\nrequired.  8(a)  statements  starting  out  detailed  particulars  of  such  application  the\\nstatement showing the application details  of the application, application number  the\\npatent office in which it is preferred date of filing all the details and an undertaking that\\nup to the date of grant of the patent in India he would keep the controller informed in\\nwriting from time to time of detail particulars as required under clause a, in respect of\\nevery other application relating to the same or substantially the same invention if any\\nfiled in any country outside India subsequent to the filing of the statement referred to in\\nthe aforesaid clause within the prescribed time.\\nNow, the first one is the statement that the applicant discloses all the pending or other\\napplications which are substantially the same, that the application number the patent\\noffice before which it is filed the details, the date on which it is file. In the second thing\\nis that the applicant gives an undertaking; the undertaking is that he will hold or he will\\nkeep the controller informed in writing from time to time. The status of every other\\napplication he has filed outside India. So, there are instances where some pharmaceutical\\ncompanies  file  30  odd  or  50  odd  applications  around  the  world  using  the  PCT\\nmechanism or the convention mechanism in all those cases if there is an application\\npending in India, the applicant is duty bound to disclose the status of all the other 30 odd\\nor 50 odd applications that are pending elsewhere. And this undertaking will hold good\\nor the applicant will have to keep the undertaking up until the grant of the patent in India.\\nSo, as I said this  gives the patent  office the benefit of what is happening in other\\njurisdictions. So, let us take hypothetical instance where an application is filed in ten\\n 242  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 245}), Document(page_content='jurisdictions  including  India;  and  during  the  course  of  the  prosecution  7  major\\njurisdictions  have  rejected  that  application,  and  when  the  application  comes  for\\nexamination in India this will give the patent office an extra information that if 7 major\\npatent offices have rejected this application, in the patent office will probably look at that\\napplication more seriously or it will take much more studied view of that application,\\nbecause now the patent office knows this status of what happened to the same application\\nand 7 other major jurisdictions.\\nSo, this is a way in which the patent office can know what is happening to similar\\napplications in other jurisdictions, but this is not through a cooperation between the\\npatent office’s rather the duty is casted on the applicant to furnish this information. 8(2)\\nsays at any time after the application for the patent is filed in India and till the grant of\\nthe patent or refusal to grant the patent made there on, the controller may also require the\\napplicant to furnish details as may be prescribed relating to the processing of application\\nin a country outside India, and in that even the applicant self furnish to the controller\\ninformation available with him within such period as may be prescribed.\\nNow, 8(2) gives the controller the power to require the applicant to furnish details.

Similarly, if the\\ncorrection is a substantive correction and we understand it as a substantive correction\\nbecause 78(4) uses the word materially alters the meaning or scope of the document. So,\\nin something materially alters the meaning or scope of a document, we do not understand\\nthat as a mere clerical correction, we understand that as a substantive correction.

So, the notice of the\\nproposed correction needs to be published. \\n78(5) within the prescribed time after any such publication as aforesaid any person\\ninterested may give notice to the controller of opposition of the request. Now this brings\\nin opposition proceedings. So, if there is a material alteration or a correction that can\\nmaterially alter the meaning and or scope of a document, if there is a notice given for\\nsuch a proposed correction a person can oppose it. So, just how a person can oppose an\\namendment  under section  57, we will  soon see  how  amendments  under section  57\\noperate, a person can also oppose a proposed correction. And where such notice of an\\nopposition is given the controller shall give notice thereof to the person by whom the\\nrequest was made and shall give to him and to the opponent an opportunity to be heard\\nbefore he decides the case.\\nSo, the proceeding from once an opposition is instituted against a proposed correction\\nthen the rules mentioned in chapter 6 of the patent rules will apply to those cases.

Similarly, the examiner files as\\nreport and the controller applies as mind on the report and he prepare the statement of\\nfirst objection.

Priority is the concept that decides when a patent application was\\nfiled with regard to determining novelty. Novelty as we have discussed before is the fact\\nthat an invention has to be new and novelty is connected to the concept of anticipation\\nand invention is regarded as new if it is not anticipated by the prior art. In order to\\ndetermine anticipation or in order to determine whether an invention is new, we look at\\nthe priority date of the invention. So, the priority date is the concept that is tied to the\\ndisclosure of the invention, when the invention is disclosed and based on the priority\\ndate, we are able to determine whether an invention is new.\\nSo, if there is a disclosure before the date of the priority, that disclosure can affect the\\nnovelty of the invention. So, the priority date refers to that point in time from which the\\ninvention will be regarded as new. As the concept priority date is tied to the claim of a\\ncomplete specification, they may be a disclosure made in a provisional specification,\\n 271  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 274}), Document(page_content='they may be a disclosure made in the descriptive part of a complete specification, but\\npriority is only tied to the claim. So, 11(1) begins by a statement that they shall be a\\npriority date for each claim of a complete specification. So, each claim regardless of the\\nnumber of claims that are there should have an independent priority. Now why is that so?\\nBecause we have seen that they could be instances where claims are craft out of various\\ndisclosures that are made by different provisional specifications. We have seen instances\\nwhere provisional specifications could be filed one after the other, and you could follow\\nall the provisional specification with one complete specification provided that complete\\nspecification is filed within 12 months from the first provisional specification.\\nThis tells us that if there are multiple disclosures of aspects of the same invention made\\npursuant to filing different provisional specifications, it is possible to capture all the\\ndisclosures together through the filing of one complete specification. Needless to say,\\nthat complete specification will have multiple claims which were disclosed at different\\npoints in time. Now understand this as a case where all the disclosures that were made in\\nthe provisional specification was captured in the complete specification, but in different\\nclaims. So, if the disclosures were made on a monthly basis and we are refer to this\\nhypothetical instance of provisionals being filed on the first of every month. So, you had\\na provisional filed on Jan first of particular year, disclosing an aspect of the invention\\nthen you had another provisional filed on unrelated aspect on Feb first then on March\\nfirst and April first you had 4 disclosures.\\nSo, when you follow this with the complete specification say in may, and assumed that\\nthe complete specification does not add anything, but just compiles all the disclosures\\nmade in the earlier 4 provisional specifications, you are likely to have a minimum of 4\\nclaims. Assuming again that there were 4 different disclosures made which were related\\nto each other. So, you could have a minimum of 4 claims, these 4 claims will have a\\npriority date that goes back to the first disclosure. So, assume that the claim 1 relates to\\nthe disclosure made in January first made in the provisional specification file on January\\nfirst then that claim, claim number 1 will have a priority date that starts from Jan first.\\nClaim  number  2  covers  a  disclosure  made  by  the  provisional  specification  file  on\\nFebruary first and claim 2 priority date will begin from February first and so on.\\nSo, we understand from this that claims in a complete specification can have different\\npriorities  or  they  could  also  have  same  priority.  For  instance,  you  file  a  complete\\n 272  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 275}), Document(page_content='specification there is no history of a provisional specification, what you file for the first\\ntime is the complete and at that point all the claims are going to have the same priority\\nbecause these claims have been disclose for the first time. So, it is possible for claims to\\nhave the same priority all the claims to have the same priority, but as a rule 11(1) tells us\\nthat each claim will have a priority date. As a priority date is significant as we mention to\\ndetermine novelty of an invention. So, anything any disclosure before the priority date\\npertaining to the invention can affect the novelty, we can say that they could be a case for\\nanticipation of what is disclosed before, and any disclosure that is made above the same\\ninvention after that priority date can be a matter of potential infringement.\\nSo, if the disclosure when before your priority date it could affect the novelty of your\\ninvention, if the disclosure happens after your priority date you could have the case of\\ninfringement against that disclosure or against that person who makes the disclosure of\\nobviously, after the grant of the patent. 11(2) gives you instances where claims in a\\ncomplete specification can have different priorities. Now 11(2) the corresponding or the\\nrelevant provision is a case which we saw in section 9(3), section 9(3) you will recall is a\\ncase where a specification was filed perfecting to be a complete specification, and that\\ncould be downgraded as a provisional. We saw an instance where disclosed could be\\nmade in a document that is purported to be a complete and the applicant to could request\\nat anytime within 12 months from the date of filing the application to downgrade or to\\ntreat the complete as a provisional and then to proceed accordingly.\\nSo, whenever disclosures are made at different points and time, and based on those\\ndisclosure claims a file the claims are likely to have different priorities. 11(2) tell us that\\nwhere a complete specification as file pursuant to a single application accompanied by a\\ncomplete a accompanied by a provisional specification, or specification which is treated\\nby virtue of a direction under subsection 3 of 9 that is the purported complete as a\\nprovisional, and the claim is fairly based on the matter disclosed in the specification\\nreferred to enclose a or b, the priority date of the claim shall be the date of filing the\\nrelevant specification. Now we had already mentioned fair basis or the phrase fairly\\nbased pertains to the fact that a disclosure that is made has to be followed by a claim and\\nif the claim is fairly based on an earlier disclosure, the claim takes that earlier priority.\\n11(2) gives to instances one an instance where a provisional specification filed, and we\\nsaw from the language of form 2 a provisional specification need not have a claim.\\n 273  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 276}), Document(page_content='So, provisional specification only has a broad disclosure and it need not have a claim.\\nSo, 11(2) tells us 2 instances; the first instance where a provisional is filed and the claim\\nis fairly based on the matter disclosed in that provisional specification is file at a later\\npoint in time by way of a complete, then the priority date of that claim shall be the date\\nof filing that relevant specification and by relevant specification they are referring to the\\nprovisional. So, if there is a provisional file with the disclosure after say 6 months, you\\nfile a complete with a claim and the claim is actually carved out of that disclosure which\\nyou made in the provisional specification, then the priority date of the claim will be the\\ndate of the disclosure made in the provisional. So, keep this in mind fair basis is all about\\nmapping a disclosure to a claim. So, there is a disclosure made of the inventive concept\\nor the invention and you file a claim at a later point in time.\\nNow, this mapping would normally happen when there is a provisional followed by the\\ncomplete route as I mentioned sometime back, you could directly file a complete. In that\\ncase this mapping need not be there because the complete has claims  in it and the\\ncompletes the claims are supported by the description. So, the description and the claims\\nwhere disclosed at the same point in time they both have the priority is the same, because\\nthe disclosure and the claim happened at the same point. 11(2) talks about when the\\ndisclosure  and  the  claims  happened  are  filed  or  at  different  points  provisional\\nspecification has the disclosure which when it is followed by a claim at a later point in\\ntime, the claim will have the priority from the disclosure the world you will find that in\\n11(2) their own use the word disclosure rather they use the word matter disclosed it\\npertains to the same.\\nSo, when the disclosure is made for the first time and is followed up by a claim at a later\\npoint in time in a complete specification, the complete specification can take the priority\\nof the disclosure and what is the yardstick for this? The yardstick is that the claim should\\nbe fairly based on the matter disclosed; it should be fairly based on the disclosure made\\nin the specification. Now the second condition in 11(2) the first condition was where a\\nprovisional  follows  the  complete  the  second  condition  or  second  type  of  claiming\\npriority from an matter disclosed pertains to what we call specification treated as a\\npurported complete I mean it was filed it was purported to be a complete specification,\\nbut for whatever reason the applicant fell that it is not complete and the applicant wanted\\nto downgraded or to convert the purported complete into a provisional.\\n 274  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 277}), Document(page_content='Now, in  that  case  again  you  are  going  to  have  disclosures  different  from  claims;\\nunderstand the purported complete having something in, at disclosure. Now when you\\nconvert that into a provisional you get more time to file a complete obviously, you\\nshould have more time because the time will accrue 9(3) tells us that the time will accrue\\nfrom the date of filing the first specification which is the purported specification. So, you\\nwill definitely have more time to file a complete, because now you have regarded the\\ncomplete that you filed as a provisional. So, when you follow it up with another filing,\\nthere will be a case where there I been disclosures made earlier and claims filed later.\\nSo, when this happens, the concept of fire basis can step in. Now you can see whether\\nthose claims that were file later could be mapped or fairly based or can be derived from\\nthe earlier disclosure. Again, in this case we could regard the claims as having priority\\nfrom the date on which the earlier matter was disclosed. Now section 11(2) talks about 2\\ninstances both instances pertain to a provisional followed by a complete, and in both the\\ninstances if the claim in the complete can be mapped or can be fairly based on the matter\\ndisclosed earlier it takes the priority. So, priority as I said is tied to the claim priority as a\\nconcept is tied to claim every claim needs to have a priority and the priority can shift\\nbased on the disclosure made based on the matter disclosed if the matter was disclosed\\nearlier to the filling of the claims then they get the priority from that earlier date.\\n(Refer Slide Time: 13:17)\\n 275  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 278}), Document(page_content='11(3) gives yet another instance where a complete specification is filed or preceded in\\npursuance  of  2  or  more  applications  accompanied  by  the  specifications  as  I  am\\nmentioned in subsection 2, and the claim is fairly based on the matter disclosed.\\nNow, the corresponding relevant provision is a similar instance is mentioned in section\\n9(2). Section 9(2) you will recollect talks about 2 or more applications of a filed which\\nare followed up by one complete you could file multiple provisionals and followed up by\\na complete. Now this talk about a similar case where a complete is file pursuant to many\\n1, 2 or more Provisionals.\\n(Refer Slide Time: 14:03)\\nNow, its further states that in one of those applications the priority date of the claim shall\\nbe the date of filing the application accompanied by that specification. Partly in one and\\npartly in the other the priority date of the claim shall be the date of filing the application\\naccompanied  by  the  specification  in  the  later  date.  Now  this  again  is  tied  to  the\\ndisclosure now a tells us that in one of those specification the priority date of the claim\\nshall be the date of filing the application  accompanied by that specification,  which\\nsimply means that if the disclosure is complete the date on which the disclosure was\\ncompletely done you get the priority date from that.\\nSo, you file a claim in your complete specification and the claim can be mapped to a\\ncomplete disclosure. Complete disclosure as a whatever is claimed in that particular\\nclaim has been completely disclosed in one point and time earlier. Regardless of whether\\n 276  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 279}), Document(page_content='came in the first provisional law the second or the third it was completely disclosed. So,\\na tell us if the disclosure in made in one of those specification, the priority date of the\\nclaim shall be the date of filing the application accompanied by that specification. So, it\\nrelates to an earlier date and what is the cashier? The cashier is the disclosure should I\\nhave been complete it should completely cover what is now being claim; b is the other\\nside of the coin b says if the disclosure is in partly in one and partly in the other. So, what\\ndoes this partly mean? The inventive concept or the invention as it is been claimed in one\\nparticular claim, the disclosure happened in 2 paths what is now been claimed in one\\nclaim the disclosure happened in 2 paths, it came in a provisional specification say a\\nprovisional specification file and January First; it came first, and partly another part of\\nthe in invention came in disclosure made in a provisional specification file on February\\nfirst.\\nNow, together these 2 disclosures made one claim. So, in that case if the disclosure is\\nmade partly in one and partly in another, the priority dates shall be the date of filing the\\napplication accompanied by the specification of the later date. It simply means when the\\ndisclosure was completed that will be your priority date. So, it is again tied to the\\nconcept which we saw in the first case; a disclosure you can claim the priority from a\\ndisclosure if the disclosure is complete. If the disclosure is done in paths then we take the\\nlatter date because the latter date is when the disclosure became complete. So, against the\\nsame concept that is covered in a and b, (a) talk about an instance where the disclosure is\\nmade in 1 go, (b) talks about an instance where a disclosure is made in part first the\\nresult disclosure and followed by another disclosure at a later point at time and in both\\nthe cases we see whether the disclosure was complete if the matter disclosed was got\\ncompleted at the second instance, then the priority date will become will be the date on\\nwhich the disclosure got completed.\\nNow, it is the just not a case of partly you in one and partly the other, say there are 10\\ndisclosures and all the ten disclosures are now captured in one clay. So, which essentially\\nmeans paths of the invention was disclosed in 10 bits and you followed it up with one\\nsingle  claim.  Now  the  priority  date  of  that  claim  will  be  when  the  disclosure  got\\ncompleted which was the tenth disclosure. So, the priority date will start from tenth\\ndisclosure because that is the point at which the disclosure was completed. So, 11(3)\\ntells us that disclosure you can has to be complete and complete in the sense that what is\\n 277  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 280}), Document(page_content='being claim should be fully in that disclosure if it is not fully in that disclosure. If it is in\\n2  different  disclosures  or  3  or  more  different  disclosures  then  we  see  when  the\\ndisclosures put together completed the invention that is now being claim.\\nSo, if it happened at the third disclosure if the invention as it is claim was complete, then\\nwe regard the third disclosure as a starting point of the priority.\\n(Refer Slide Time: 18:41)\\n.\\nIn 11(3)(a) the fact that the disclosure when it is complete, now in 11(3) you had 2\\ninstances where the first case was the disclosure was complete. So, you get the priority\\nfrom that and the second instance where the disclosure was not complete it was in paths;\\nwhen it is a path we see when it got completed. Now the same concept is repeated in (3)\\n(a) where a complete specification based on a previously filed application in India has\\nbeen filed within 12 months from the date of application, which is the normal case for\\nany  complete  specification  it  has  to  be  filed  within  12  months  from  the  previous\\napplication, which is in most cases it is a provisional.

So, if the disclosure within is\\ndifferent paths as we saw in 11(3), then whenever the disclosure got completed then that\\nis the point at which the priority starts. (3)(a) talks about the disclosure where it is\\nassumed that it is a complete one. So, if the disclosure is complete then we go to the first\\ndisclosure because it should be understood as the first complete disclosure.\\nSo, whenever the disclosure is complete whenever the disclosure is or a claim is based\\non this matter that is disclosed in one go, then we regard the first point of disclosure.\\nThey understanding is that in the first disclosure the entire invention that we claim was\\nfully disclosed. So, we go by the as a rule disclosure we go to the earliest point that is as\\na rule. In any case if you want to a fair basis, if the invention that is disclosed in a claim,\\nwe look at the earliest disclosure to get the priority. The only case where we do not look\\nat the earliest disclosure is if the disclosure is not complete, if the disclosure is a path it is\\nin over a period of time then we look at the point at which the disclosure got completed\\nwith regard to the matter claim.\\n(Refer Slide Time: 21:42)\\n11(4) introduces section 16, which you will know pertains to divisional applications and\\nwe have still not we have made a passing reference to divisional application, divisional\\n 279  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 282}), Document(page_content='applications are filed when it could be filed voluntarily by the applicant or it could be\\nalso be filed based on a direction by the controller.\\nDivisional applications are filed when there is more than one invention claimed in a\\nspecification. The law states that they can be only one application for an invention if\\nthere are more than one invention there have to be more than one application. 11(4) talks\\nabout a instance where there is a divisional application, where a complete specification\\nhas been filed in pursuance of a further application made by virtue of subsection 1 of 16,\\nand a claim is fairly based on the matter disclosed in any of the earlier specifications\\nprovisional or a complete as the case may be, the priority date of the claim shall be the\\ndate of filing the specification in which the matter was first disclosed. It is the same\\nprinciple when an invention is fairly based on a disclosure that is made then the priority\\ndate will accrue from the date on which the disclosure was first made, when the matter\\nwas first disclosed the principle remains the same the claim will always look at the point\\nof first disclosure. The only exception is if the first disclosure is not complete then we\\nlook at the point at which the disclosure got completed.\\nNow, this still goes by the same principle that the claim will always get the priority of the\\nfirst disclosure, but in this case the application in walls a divisional. So, only it is just\\nthat it is not the usual case of a provisional followed by a complete, it is a case of a\\ncomplete followed by a complete or a provisional followed by a complete and another\\ncomplete, because divisional is always done on a complete you cannot do a divisional on\\na provisional for the simple fact that there are no claims in a provisional for you to\\ndetermine whether there are more than one inventions in an application. The key to\\ndetermine whether you have covered more than one invention in an application, whether\\nyou have violated the rule of unity of invention is to look into the claims.\\nSo, if there are no claims for you to scrutinize, then it will be very hard for you to make\\nthe case that the application actually covered more than one invention. So, divisional\\nalways comes in where a complete is filed, and either the applicant feels that there is\\nmore than one invention or the patent of it is feel so, the application can now be divided\\nwhen we may mention the application, we are referring to a complete specification can\\nnow be divided into a further application which is also a complete. Because whenever we\\ntalk about divisional, we are talking about dividing a set of claims into 2 applications.\\nSo, the set of planes which we are cover in one application since it was felt the cover\\n 280  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 283}), Document(page_content='more than one invention, they have to now become the part of another application. So,\\ninevitably  you  are  going  to  look  at  instances  in  a  divisional  where  a  complete\\nspecification got divided into one other complete specification; when we say divisional it\\nis not the same application be divided in to 2 the main application now has a child.\\nSo, we use the word parent and child mother and child. So, the first application filed\\napplication is regarded as the parent, and the later filed application is regarded as the\\nchild the other divisional. So, the principal remains is same in 11, claim gets the priority\\nfrom the earliest disclosure what we call the first disclose. In this case the first disclosure\\ncan be either in a provisional or in a complete. So, the only difference here is in the\\nearlier case we saw a provisional being followed by a complete in this it could be a\\ncomplete that follows a complete the principle remains the same. And again priority or\\nthe rules  of priority are relevant  only when claims  and the disclosures are filed in\\ndifferent points in time.\\nSo, whenever you file a divisional, you are going to claim or remove certain claims and\\nput it in the different application on a different date. So, your divisional is not going to\\nhave because you file the divisional later in time it is not going to have the same date of\\nfiling as of the mother application or the parent application. So, because there is a\\ndifference in some set of claims which you file later point and time, and a disclosure that\\nwas made at a different point and time you need to look at priority. As I said priority as a\\nconcept becomes relevant when the disclosure and the claim are made in at different\\npoints and time. And divisional is a classic case where the claims will have different\\nfiling dates if the classic case because you had filled application the patent of a feels or\\nyou as an applicant feel that there are more than one invention and you file a divisional\\napplication removing some claims from the earlier application and making it into an\\nindependent application.\\nSo, there is a difference or the later filled application or the divisional is file at a different\\npoint in time. So, whenever there is a difference in the time of filing the disclosure and\\nthe claim, the rules of priorities will settle. 11(5) is the blanket provision which covers\\ninstances the foregoing provisions of this section which is 1, 2, 3, 3(A) and 4 any claim\\nof a complete specification would for the provisions of this subsection have 2 or more\\npriority dates the priority date of that claims shall be the earlier or earliest of those dates.\\nNow it is possible for a claim to have multiple priorities; multiple properties in the sense\\n 281  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 284}), Document(page_content='that  there  was  the  disclosure  made  and  there  was  a  claim  file  there  was  another\\ndisclosure made and again a claim file, and you feel that there are some claims now is\\nthere are multiple disclosures made and multiple claims file based on them, it is possible\\nthat claims can be mapped not only to the 2 different disclosures, the same part of a\\ninvention that is covered in a claim could now we map to different disclosures, the\\ndisclosure you made on January first and some paths of the invention in it the one which\\nyou made on February first again had some path of the invention.\\nNow, you are able to look when you look at the priority of a claim you see that the claim\\nis  also  covered  in  the  February  disclosure,  and  the  claim  is  also  covered  by  the\\ndisclosures you made in January. So, in that case you will look at the earliest point of the\\ndisclosure and claim the priority from the earlier state. This is in tuned with what we saw\\nin section 11(4) that the matter that was first disclosed. So, you always go to the first\\ndisclosure, again the catchers the first disclosure as to be complete. So, in January when\\nyou made a disclosure if it was complete and in February you made the disclosure and\\nagain the disclosure got repeated here, if you make a claim then you are entitled to claim\\nthe earliest priority which is you will obviously, claim the disclosure that you made in\\nJanuary.\\nSo, 5 says that where a claim has 2 or more priority dates and how does a claim have 2 or\\nmore  priority dates  by the  share fact  that  there  is  a it  can be mapped  to  different\\ndisclosures. You have a choice and especially in a case where you file ten provisional\\nspecifications  and follow  it up with one complete,  they could be instance  that you\\ndisclosed an aspect of invention to multiple times because you have to for the sake of\\ncompletion you have to repeat what you had filed in an earlier occasion.\\nSo, they could be overlapping disclosures and if a claim can get the benefit of multiple\\ndisclosures, 11(5) tells us that the applicant can claim the earliest disclosure which was\\ncomplete in it is sense as the priority date. 11(6) is again another blanket provision and\\nthe relevant provision is section 137 which deals with international applications, in any\\ncase to which subsections 2, 3, 3(A), 4 and 5 do not apply and you should understand\\nthat in any case where there is a difference in the timeline of the disclosure and the filing\\nof the claim which is what it means. The priority date of claim shall subject to provisions\\nof section 137 which is applies to an international application, be the date of filing of the\\ncomplete specification.\\n 282  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 285}), Document(page_content='This is very simple statement which says that if you have not made a disclosure and at\\none point and followed it up with the claim at another point in time, then in all other\\ncases it is assumed that the disclosure and the claim are filed at the same point which is\\nwhat you would do if you file a complete specification. Now for a moment remove this\\nentire idea about a provisional specification followed by a complete from your mind, and\\nassume that you are filing a complete for the first time and the complete has everything\\nin it. The disclosure is perfect every aspect of the invention is completely flushed out and\\nall the claims are there in your complete; when you file the complete there is no need for\\nyou to do the mapping because the disclosure, which is there in the descriptive part and\\nthe claims their file on the same date.\\nSo, this is a case where the disclosure from which and we saw that all claims have to be\\nfairly based on the disclosure that is a requirement in section 10, when the disclosure\\ndiscloses all the aspects that are claim and both the disclosure and the claims are file\\ntogether which will be a case when you fail a complete specification, then the complete\\nspecification will have the date of priority on the date of filing. The principle is so simple\\nbecause there was no earlier disclosure. So, in cases where there is no earlier disclosure\\nby which we mean there is no earlier provisional or earlier parent application followed\\nby divisional and all these cases, there is no earlier disclosure whatsoever the first thing\\nyou file is the complete specification, and the complete specification is fully discloses\\nthe matter then in that case the priority date will be the date of filing the complete\\nspecification.\\nSo, 11 6 tells us that in 2, 3, 3(A), 4 and 5 we had instances where a disclosure proceeded\\nthe filing of the claim. In all those instances you have to do the mapping fair basis will be\\nto an external document. In fix removing these exceptions if there is only a complete\\nspecification file, then fair basis will be to what is disclosed in the same document. So, I\\nhope you are able to get this, as long as the disclosure and the claims are in a single\\ndocument then the priority will be the date of filing because it happened on the same\\nway. If the disclosure is on a different document on a different date say a provisional\\nfollowed a by a complete, then you will have to do this exercise of mapping it back to the\\ndisclosure whether the disclosure was the first disclosure, whether the disclosure was\\ncomplete knowledge sense, if it was an path, then when did the paths get completed you\\nhave to look at all the rules that we saw in sections sub sections 1 to 5.\\n 283  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 286}), Document(page_content='(Refer Slide Time: 34:17)\\n11(7) talks about 2 concepts which are important from the perspective of understanding\\npriority, 11(7) talks about both post dating which we have already seen in section 9 and it\\nalso talks about antedating, which I will briefly mentioned in the context of divisional\\napplications. Now post dating is giving up a priority date and shifting the priority date to\\na later date let us put it that way I am trying to explain this from the perspective of\\npriority dates. If you post date and application say you file a provisional on January first\\nand you file a complete based on that provisional on June first, and for whatever reason\\nyou want to cancel the provisional you do not want the provisional to be there you want\\nto withdraw the provisional. So, you indicate to the controller that please cancel my\\nprovisional and the consequence of cancelling the provisional is that the disclosure you\\nmade in the provisional is no longer can be used for determining priority.\\nSo, the controller be forced to post date your application which means giving up the\\npriority date on the provisional because now there is no provisional, and post dated to the\\ndate of filing the complete. So, the date of priority now shifts from January first to June\\nfirst. So, this is postdating you give up an earlier priority and shifted to a later date\\nbecause you have removed the underlying reason for demanding that priority. What were\\nthe underlying reasons here? There was a provisional which you want to withdraw. 17\\nwhen we come to 17, I will explain that is again post dating in the context in another\\ncontext. So, post dating we have already covered section 9 post dating is giving up an\\nearlier date and moving it to a later date because of an underlying reason, 9 talks about\\n 284  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 287}), Document(page_content='the underlying reason as withdrawing the provisional. So, when there is no provisional\\nyou cannot claim or when you withdrawn the provisional you cannot claim anything\\nbased on that disclosure, because then it does not become a part of the official record and\\nit will become very hard for a coat or the intellectual property appellate board to look at\\nthis because the underlying document was not there.\\nSo, the of his will not give you the priority if they underlying priority document in this\\ncase a provisional is removed. Antedating is the reverse of it, you file application on June\\nfirst and because you have already filed something on Jan first January first, you could\\nclaim the priority of January first because the claim in the applications filed in June first\\nactually is based on a disclosure that went in January first. Now understand on January\\nfirst you file a complete specification which is complete in all aspects, the only issue\\nwith that complete specification is that you disclosed more than one invention. You\\nrealize that in June and on June first you file a divisional which is what section 16 is all\\nabout. When you file the divisional you are going to remove certain claims from the\\napplication filed on January first and put it in your June first application.\\nNow, the June first application though it has got claims and it is file on a different date,\\nthe disclosure can relate back to what you made in your January first application, what\\nwe call the parent of the mother application. So, the June first application becomes a\\nchild which they get it is priority from the matter that was disclosed because it is just an\\nexercise of removing the claims. It gets is priority based on the disclosure and the\\ndisclosure was made the first of January. In this case later filed application gets the\\npriority of an earlier filed application. So, the later filed application for the process of\\npriority is antedated. So, this is the opposite of post dating. So, post dating happens in the\\nconcept of giving up a provisional, antedating happens in instances where a divisional is\\nfiled and the divisional claims it is priority from the parent. Section 11(7) tells us that in\\ncases where there is post dating or antedating the reference to the date of filing the\\napplication shall be the date as so post dated or antedated.\\nSo,  date  of  filing  we  saw  in  11(6)  pertains  to  the  priority  data  where  there  is  no\\ndifference in the date of disclosure of the matter disclosed, and the date of filing the\\nclaim. In other words, date of filing is relevant where you file a complete specification if\\nthe date of filing is changed because of postdating or antedating, 11(7) tells us that the\\ndate of filing will then be the date so post dated or antedated.\\n 285  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 288}), Document(page_content='So, in the first instance in section 9 if you give up your priority be because you had to\\nwithdraw a provisional specification, then the date of priority also gets shifted to the later\\ndate. In section 16 if you file a divisional and if you are able to claim priority from the\\nparent, then the date of filing is shifted to the date of filing the patent which means the\\ndate of filing as a default case the date of filing is the priority date. So, the date of\\npriority is antedated or the date of priority in section 9 it gets post dated. So, 11(8) talks\\nof the instances where a disclosure made will not affect the validity of a patent. Now for\\na patent to be valid it has to satisfy the basic requirements of novelty inventive step and\\nutility or the fact that the invention is capable of industrial application. Now these 3\\nconcepts if it is not there or if it is not proved to be there can be reasons for invalidating a\\npatent.\\nPriority is tied to the concept of novelty. So, if the priority is wrongly claimed if the date\\non which the priority was actually claimed, there a been certain disclosures then the\\npatent can be invalidated for lack of novelty. So, invalidity is understood as the absence\\nof the requirements of patentability, that is one way to understand it because invalidity\\ncan also come because of certain grounds other than the grounds for patentability, it\\ncould also come because of certain other grounds like fraud could be a ground for\\ninvalidating a patent under section 64, but in this context for the sake of priority we\\nunderstand invalidity as a concept that can raise a challenge on a patent, if the priority is\\nnot claimed in the right way or if there is a disclosure before the priority date. Now 11(8)\\na tells us that a claim in a complete specification of a patent shall not be invalid by\\nreason only of publication or use of the instance, so far it is claimed in that claim on or\\nafter the priority date of that claim.\\nNow, we have been telling you that anything that happens after the priority date any\\ndisclosure that happens after the priority date cannot affect your invention. It cannot be a\\nreason for determining invalidity it cannot be a reason for challenging the novelty of the\\napplication. Now this is the reason why many inventors file a provisional and later on go\\nfor conferences or go for discussions and disclose the invention to others, because the\\nday you file your provisional you can claim priority from that date.\\nSo, say assume that you file a provisional on June first, and on June seventh you make a\\ndisclosure of the invention to an audience. Now because you had preserved the priority\\nbefore you made the public disclosure under 11(8) your disclosure which you made on\\n 286  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 289}), Document(page_content='June seventh cannot be a reason for invalidating your patent. It only is it is clearly says\\nthat any disclosure in 11(8)(a) it says any publication or use on or after the priority date\\nshall not be a reason for invalidating the patent.\\nSo, any disclosure you make after the priority date does not affect your novelty and it\\ncannot  be a reason it cannot be anticipation  because it happens  after the date.  So,\\nanticipation something has which happened before the date of your disclosure. 11(8)(b)\\nsays another instance the grant of another patent which claims the invention, so far as\\nclaimed in the first mention claim, in a claim of the same or a later priority date. Now\\nassume that you have preserved your priority on June first 2017, now if another patent\\ngets granted after you preserve the priority that cannot be a ground for invalidating your\\npa patent. So, far as your claim had a priority that was earlier to it or on the same day.\\nSo, the later patent see patents can get granted at different points and time. So, you could\\nfile a patent in 2017, your competitive could file it just after few days after you and you\\ncould preserve you could have a priority before your competitors’ priority because you\\nare you file the complete specification before your competitor.\\nAssume that your competitor files it after a week of you filing your application, but for\\nsome reason the competitor gets an earlier grant it is quite possible because they could be\\nobjections raised in your case and it could take you could take some time and replying to\\nit,  for  whatever  reason  the  competitor  got  a  grant  before  you.  Just  because  your\\ncompetitor gat got a grand before you, if his priority is not before you us his grant cannot\\nbe a reason to invalidate your patent this is what 11(8)(b) tells us. The grant of another\\npatent which claims the invention, so far as claimed in the first mention claim in a claim\\nof the same or the later priority date. So, as we mentioned grant of a patent cannot\\nchallenge the priority date of an earlier invention, if the claim has the same priority date\\nor a later priority date. Now constantly there are issues which come with regard to\\npatents that are filed at the same time I mean most of the hypothetical it is interesting to\\nlook at these dates and to post questions as to when claim gets is priority from.\\nIf 2 inventors invent us invention without any cooperation between them parallely they\\ninvent the same invention and they file a patent application on the same day. So, let us\\ntake both of them file a patent application on June first 2017, one of the inventors get a\\npatent granted earlier and time. Now the patent that is granted earlier cannot be the\\nreason for questioning the other persons invention because both their priorities are the\\n 287  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 290}), Document(page_content='same. So, they will be allowed to continue based on the language in section 11(8)(b),\\nbecause if the grant of the other patent which claims the invention, so far as the claim in\\nthe first mention claim, in a claim of the same or later priority. If the priority is later\\nobviously, we know that it cannot be a ground for challenge, but if even of the priorities\\nsame 11(8), 8 else us that it cannot be a ground for challenge.\\nSo, priority has to be prior in time. So, the same date again cannot be the ground for a\\nchallenge. It will be a very rare case where 2 people having the same invention claiming\\nit in the same language file it on the same day as I said it only happens in hypothetical\\ncases. But if that is to happened say that by some sweet coincidence 2 people cover the\\nsame invention and file it on the same day, under 11(8)(b) both of them will survive one\\ncannot challenge the other because it says the grant of the other patent in a claim of the\\nsame or later priority date will not affected. So, if this the same date it cannot affect or it\\ncannot be used to validate the other patent.\\n(Refer Slide Time: 48:04)\\nCan a claim have 2 or more priority dates now there is a difference in approaches from\\nvarious jurisdictions, some jurisdictions have hell that claims cannot have 2 or more\\npriority dates for the simple fact that if it is completely disclosed at one point and time\\nthat  is  the  only  priority  date,  other  jurisdictions  have  held  that  claims  could  have\\ndifferent priority dates based on if the matter on which the claim is based on was is\\ndisclosed repeatedly.\\n 288  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 291}), Document(page_content='(Refer Slide Time: 48:33)\\nFor instance, if there is a mechanical device which is a combination of 5 existing devices\\nsay there is a camera, there is a timer, there is a touch screen, there is thermostat and\\nthere is a accelerometer just say that a mechanical device with these 5 things.

So, in India\\nthe courts in India can enforce a patent that is granted by the patent office in India.\\nSimilarly, a patent that is granted in Sri Lanka can be enforced by the Sri Lankan courts\\nit cannot be enforced in India.\\nThis is how all the laws have developed not just patent law. So, laws are specific to the\\nterritory in which they have application. The reason why we do not have a world level\\n 295  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 298}), Document(page_content='patent is that we still do not have a world level in cooperation of companies, and we do\\nnot have a world level recognition of a property owned by one person in another country.\\nIn fact, even a contract that is signed between 2 parties becomes hard to enforced it in\\nanother country, unless that country is able to bring in some kind of a jurisdiction for\\nlooking into that contract.\\nSo, why we do not have this there has been efforts to harmonize the patent laws of\\ndifferent countries, but we still have not reached the point where we can have a global\\ncooperation on granting and enforcing patents. Is there a possibilities of filing patents for\\nthe same invention in different countries? Yes, we have 2 mechanism which will be\\ncovering in the course of our lectures. 1 is what by filing a conventional application by\\nwhich you can file an application in one country and pick it up for prosecution in another\\ncountry or you could follow the patent cooperation treaty route, the PCT route. These are\\n2 mechanisms or international arrangements for filing patent applications in different\\ncountries.\\nAre there any differences in benefits to the patentees from every country? Patents are\\nexclusive raise granted over inventions, all countries grant these rights enforcement in in\\nsome countries could be much more effective and based on the technology and the\\nmarket granting patents in certain countries could have a benefit to the person who wants\\nthose patents. So, otherwise the terms are the same the rights that conferred by the patent\\nare the same, but their territorial is specific again, to emphasize what is granted in India\\ncannot be enforced across the border say in Bangladesh or in Sri Lanka.\\nI should make a special mention about mister Pankaj Kumar he has been very active on\\nthe  forum  when  he  is  been  answering  others  queries  too.

So, from here on till the chapter on compulsory licenses we regard that as\\npatent prosecution things that happen at the patent office.\\nSo, once the application is filed. So, we know the relevant forms it has to be form one\\nplus  form  2  and  form  one  at  the  end  tells  us  about  various  other  supplementary\\ndocuments that you need to keep once the application is filed the application the first\\ninstance of action or rather the first instance of official action that happens from the side\\nof the patent office is publication of this application. So, what you have done. So, far\\nyour filled in forms you put it inside the patent office the patent office gets interested in\\napplication in the official sense only when the application is published.\\nNow, I use the word in the official sense because there is also a scrutiny that happens for\\nevery application you file though it is not a scrutiny of the merit of your application it is\\na scrutiny for to ensure whether some secrecy provision should be applied now there is a\\nscrutiny that happens to every application to see whether there are certain sensitive\\ninventions pertaining to national security and defense that are covered in that invention.\\nSo, that scrutiny happens it is not a scrutiny of the merit of the application it is to ensure\\nthat what pertains to national security and defense of this country are not covered in a\\npatent application and there is also a scrutiny that happens if you file a foreign filing\\nlicense if you want to file a foreign filing license or if you seek permission to file abroad\\nfirst then again your request will be looked at in not for the merit, but just it will be\\nscrutinized  quickly.  So,  apart  from  these  officially  the  patent  office  takes  up  the\\napplication for scrutiny only after the publication of the application.\\n 298  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 301}), Document(page_content='So, 11A(1) states save as otherwise provided no application for patent shall ordinarily be\\nopen to public for such period as may be prescribed.\\nNow, again we have the prescriptions coming in now the prescription is described what\\nis that such period you will find it in rule 24 and rule 24 is conveniently cross reference\\nthere. So, this period is 18 months from the date of filing the application. So, when you\\nfile an application ordinarily which means when the word ordinarily is mentioned they\\ncould be exceptions they could be extraordinary cases too ordinarily it shall not be\\nopened to the public for a period of 18 months.\\nSo, after 18 months the application is published now what is the merit of this 18-month\\nperiod where nothing gets published it is just a matter of convenience that if the applicant\\nwants to file applications  in other jurisdiction, he gets the time to do that. So, the\\n18 months period gives the applicant the time to file applications and prosecute them in\\nother jurisdictions, the 18-month period because the application is not published the\\ninformation  mention  in  the  application  will  not  come  in  to  the  public  domain  the\\nadvantage of the information not coming into the public domain is that the disclosure\\nmade in the patent application will be kept within the patent office and it will not be used\\nfor questioning novelty of the invention.\\nAssume that if an application is published immediately in India the day on which it is\\nfiled it is published on the same day or within a week after a month if the same applicant\\ntakes an application say in Sri Lanka or in Bangladesh or in the neighboring country then\\nthe fact that his own application which he filed in India was disclosed and published\\ncould be used for questioning the novelty in the application that he filed in a foreign\\ncountry say in Sri Lanka or in Bangladesh the reason being that your own application can\\nif published prior in time can kill the novelty of your applications which you file in other\\njurisdictions. So, the logic of the 18-month period is that you get enough time to have\\nyour applications in place before the first publication happens.\\nNow, assume that in applicant does not want the benefit of this 18 months assume an\\napplicant wants to file an application only in India and is not bothered about going\\nelsewhere and he is in a hurry he wants a grant quickly for whatever reason then the law\\nallows him to take a request for publication which he can do on the date of filing the\\napplication itself. So, if you take a request for publication there is a provision by which\\n 299  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 302}), Document(page_content='you can expedite the publication without having to wait for the 18-month period. So, the\\n18-month  period the wisdom behind the 18-month  period is to ensure that you  get\\nenough time if you are interested in filing applications in other jurisdictions.\\n11A(2) states that the applicant may in the prescribed manner request the controller to\\npublish his application at any time before the expiry of the period this is what we just\\nmentioned the controller shall publish such application as soon as possible now this is\\ncovered in 24A. So, rule 24A is an exception too, rule 24A request for publication under\\nsubsection 2 of 11A shall be made in form 99. So, form 9 is the relevant form which has\\nto be red in reference to 11(2)(a) and rule 24A. So, form 9 is relevant for 11A(2) and for\\nrule 24A.\\nSo, when an applicant takes files form 9 the application is published immediately. So,\\nthere is a way to circumvent the 18-month period or 18-month dormant period where the\\napplicant lies dormant no activity on the applicant because the patent office will start\\nscrutinizing it only after the application is published. So, if you want to expedite your\\nprosecution process then you could make a request for publication if you do not make a\\nrequest for publication obviously, it get published at the end of 18 months. So, once you\\nprefer an application it gets published whether you like it or not after 18 months if you\\nare in a hurry you could take form 9 and form 9 is a form which is used for to request in\\nearly publication.\\n(Refer Slide Time: 10:09)\\n 300  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 303}), Document(page_content='Now, there are some exceptions the exceptions are covered in sub section 3.

So, if there is\\na secrecy direction passed under section 35 that application is not revealed to the public\\ndomain it does not come into the public domain it is not published the publication is\\nwithheld.

So, the second case where an application will not be published after 18\\nmonths is a case where an application was not followed a provisional was not followed\\nby a complete.\\nSo,  a  provisional  is  regarded  as  abandoned  and  that  abandoned  provisional  is  not\\npublished which means the matters disclosed in that provisional cannot be used as prior\\nart for the sure fact that it is not published the third instance (c) where an application is\\nnot published after the mandatory 18 month period is where it has been withdrawn 3\\nmonths prior to the specified period under subsection one now 3 months before the end\\nof the 18 month period the application is withdrawn the form for withdrawal of the\\napplication is form 29.\\n11A(4) states that incase a secrecy direction has been given in respect of an application\\nunder section 35 then it shall be published after the expiry of the period prescribed in\\nsubsection one or when the secrecy direction as seized to operate whichever is later we\\nwill see when we discuss section 35 that there are certain things that you cannot do\\npertaining to a patent application when a secrecy direction is in operation you cannot\\npublish the application you cannot disseminate information relating to the application the\\nthat is the reason we call it a secrecy direction the direction is given to keep the matters\\ncontained in the application a secret.\\nNow, if a secrecy direction is issued under section 35 then the eventual publication of\\nthat application can happen one at the expiry of the 18-month period which is the default\\ncase or if the secrecy direction is still pending when the secrecy direction seizes to\\noperate or has seize to operate now whichever happens later the application would get\\npublished  only after  that  point.

So, 11A(5) deals with the\\npublication of an application and the corresponding provision where the application and\\nthe corresponding provision where the grant is published can be found in section 43(2)\\nstates that on the grant of the patent the controller shall publish the fact that the patent\\nhas  been granted  and there  upon the application  specification  and other documents\\nrelated thereto shall be open for public inspection.\\nNow, this indicates that the details of the grant are at the grant is published and the\\ndetails of the grant the final form in which the complete specification was granted if\\nthere  is  a  provisional  specification  and  all  these  things  will  be  open  to  public  for\\ninspection and there is a procedure before the patent office where you can seek further\\ninformation on patents by paying the required fees \\nSo,  as  we  mentioned  the  patent  application  goes  through  2  publications  the  first\\npublication is the publication of the application as filed which happens some under\\n11A(5) and this second publication is the publication of the grant which happens under\\nsection 43(2). 11A(6) states that upon publication of an application for a patent under\\nthis section (a) the depository institution shall make the biological material mentioned in\\nthis specification available to the public that we saw that under section 10(4) where in\\ncertain cases you have to deposit the biological material before a depository.

So, this is making where we had an arrangement for accepting applications\\nthrough the mail box it is made very clear that the right shall accrue only from the date of\\ngrant of the patent.\\nThere is a third proviso to 11A(7) states that provided also that after a patent is granted in\\nrespect of applications made under 5(2) the patent or holder shall only be entitled to\\nreceive reasonable royalty from such enterprises which have made significant investment\\nand where producing and marketing the concerned product prior to 01/01/2005 and\\nwhich continue to manufacture the product covered by the patent on the date of grant of\\nthe patent and no infringement proceedings shall be instituted against such enterprises \\nNow, this is again a transitory provision it is no longer relevant because you could\\nreasonably expect all the 5(2) applications to be disposed of by, it’s been 12 years post\\n2005. So, you could reasonably expect all the applications which were filed using the\\nmail  box  procedure  to  have  been  either  prosecuted  and  granted  or  prosecuted  and\\nrejected. So, this is this proviso is no longer replicable and they were probably just a\\nhandful of cases where this proviso was attracted and one such case was the Novartis\\nversus Cipla or Novartis versus Ranbaxy they were a they were a set of cases which\\nNovartis had filed against a couple of Indian generic companies in exercise of a right that\\nNovartis  had after  it  filed  its  application  in India  this  right  is  called  the  exclusive\\nmarketing right or EMR. \\nNow the EMR is again a provision which is now been deleted from the patents act earlier\\nthere was a chapter called (chapter IV A) which contained provisions from section 24A\\nto 24F which detail how an EMR operates now the EMR was a parallel right which was\\ncreated along with the mail box arrangement. So, this was the right which was created\\nwhere if a patent is granted in a foreign country which India recognizes and a drug\\nregulatory approval is also granted for that particular drug then the applicant in India in\\nthis case it was Novartis will have certain exclusive marketing rights EMR by which it\\n 310  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 313}), Document(page_content='could enforce those rights now Novartis in this case file cases against certain generics\\nwhich included Cipla Ranbaxy and sun pharmaceuticals stating that the grant of an EMR\\nwhich was again done by the patent office entitles it to stop certain generic companies\\nfrom infringing its right.\\nNow, if you look at it there was no right granted by the patent office because the patent\\napplication  was  still  under  scrutiny, but  by virtue  of  the  EMR  provision  exclusive\\nmarketing rights were granted based on a pending application now there are some details\\nto this case which there are some materials which you can also find on how the EMR\\nprovisions operated, but this provisions merely tells that the patent holder who files an\\napplication  under  5(2) shall  be  entitled  to  receive  shall  only be  entitled  to  receive\\nreasonable royalty from such enterprises which means a the relief a patentee can claim\\nfor infringement a relief a patentee can claim with regard to an application filed under\\nsection 5(2) is only reasonable royalty.\\nNow, we saw in a patent infringement suit the release could be broadly of 2 types.\\n108(1) tells us that you could stop the person from doing the infringing activity that is\\nwhat we call injunction or you could have compensation a relief in money a relief in\\nmoney could be damages or account of profits now here this proviso says that if it is a\\n5(2) application and understand a 5(2) application as in application for a pharmaceutical\\nproduct which is received in a mail box and which is not scrutinized upon the condition\\nthat it will be scrutinized and examined by the patent of his only after 2005. So, till 2005\\nnobody is going to know what is there in the mail box and that is the reason some people\\ncall their mail box as the black box. So, you do not know what is there in the mail box a\\nnormal  application  gets  published after 18 months,  but a mail  box application  gets\\nscrutinized only after it is taken up for publication post 2005.\\nNow, this arrangement could lead to certain tricky situations where generic companies in\\nIndia  where  already  manufacturing  that  drug.  So,  you  can  have  instances  like  the\\nNovartis case when Novartis filed the application in 1998 soon after Novartis filed its\\napplication  some  Indian generic  companies  started  manufacturing  the drug covering\\nimatinib mesylate which is known by Novartis and refers to it by its trade Mark Gleevec\\nthis drug though an application was spending since 1998 this drug was manufactured by\\nIndian generic companies because there was no patent protection during that time period\\ntill 2005 there was no patent protection after 2005 when the application was taken up for\\n 311  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 314}), Document(page_content='scrutiny Novartis received an EMR an exclusive marketing right while the application\\nwas spending Novartis received an EMR an exclusive marketing right based on the\\nexclusive marketing right.\\nNovartis was able to file infringement suits against these generic companies who were\\nalready manufacturing that product now EMR the provisions of exclusive marketing\\nright which are now been repealed also provided for filing infringement suits braced on\\nthe grant. Now this provision says that in such cases where manufacturers are already\\nmanufacturing the drug and the patent gets granted at a later point in time which is quite\\npossible in 5(2) scenario then the relief that the patentee can claim is only reasonable\\nroyalty the patentee cannot claim in junction in other words. So, you cannot stop a\\nperson and we saw an 108(2). The 2 broad reliefs that a person can claim are a relief to\\nstop the infringing activity or a relief in money compensation.\\nNow,  this  proviso  makes  it  very  clear  in  5(2)  scenario  where  the  application  is\\nscrutinized after 2005 if there are manufacturers. In fact, the language used is enterprises\\nin the proviso if there are enterprises which have made significant investment and where\\nproducing and marketing the concern product prior to 01/01/2005. So, if they were\\nIndian generic companies who were manufacturing that particular drug prior to 2005 first\\nof January 2005 and which continue to manufacture the product covered by the patent on\\nthe  grant  date  of  grant  of the  patent  they  were  not  only  manufacturing  it  prior  to\\n01/01/2005, but they continue to do. So, till the patent was granted this provision protects\\nthose enterprises in the Indian context Indian generic companies from an infringement\\nproceeding  because  it  clearly  states  no  infringements  proceeding  shall  be  instituted\\nagainst  such  enterprises  yet  Novartis  instituted  an  infringement  proceeding  because\\nNovartis had and other right by name the exclusive marketing rights.\\nBecause  Novartis  got  an  EMR  granted  that  EMR  allowed  Novartis  to  file  an\\ninfringement suit because the provision of the EMR allowed for filing of infringement\\nsuits.

So, 3\\nmonths prior to the ending of the 18-month period an application can be withdrawn and\\n11B(4) proviso tells us that if you are going to withdraw any time after the application is\\nfiled and before the grant you would use form 29. So, form 29 is the form that you would\\nuse for any withdrawal and that we get from the language of 11B(4) that any withdrawal\\nyou can withdraw the application at any time after filing, but before grant and for that\\nthere is a common form that is form 29.\\nNow, the effect of a publication is that upon publication the public is given notice of the\\napplication and all the information covered in the application which means the public can\\nnow people who have an interesting in knowing more information about the patent can\\nnow get the information from the patent office.

The  patent\\napplicant could make a request for publication and we had mentioned this request for\\npublication is done under rule 24A using form 9 if the patent applicant needs a quicker\\npublication then he could make a request for publication using form 9.

Publication is mandatory for\\nexamination to happen. If an application is not published then the patent office will not\\nexanimate, we have multiple evidences towards this one part of the act which points us\\ntowards that is section 9(1) where a provisional specification which is not followed by a\\ncomplete specification within the time period of 12 months is treated as abandoned.\\nAnd what is abandoned is not published; and there is another provision in the act where\\nyou could withdraw a provisional and if you withdraw that is under 9(3) if you withdraw\\nthe provisional specification again it is not published.

So, we choose the earlier date. So, the 48 months starts\\nfrom the earlier date if the priority is earlier, and we saw that priority could be different\\nfrom the date of filing of application if there is a priority document like a provisional\\nspecification and we saw the cases in section 11 where if the disclosure is made in a\\ndocument which is different from the document in which the claims are then the priority\\nrules  will  apply, and  priority  can  be acclaimed  from  the  earlier  disclosure  for  that\\nparticular claim.\\nSo, 24B(1)(i) tells us that the request for examination has to be main if the patent office\\nneeds to examine the application with in a 48-month period, and it has to be done using\\nform 18 and this 48-month period starts either from the date of priority or from the date\\nof filing of the application whichever is earlier.

So,\\nif you file if there is a no priority document and the first filing is through the complete\\nspecification, then we regard the priority date as the date of filing the date of filing\\nbecomes the priority date because the there is no earlier disclosure of the invention.

Before the first day of January 2005 a request for it\\nis examination shall be made in the prescribed manner and within the prescribed period\\nby the applicant or any other interested person.\\n(Refer Slide Time: 09:39)\\nNow, the relevant rule as you can see is rule 24B that should be capital B. 24B(1)(ii)\\nstates the period within which the request for examination under subsection 3 of 11B to\\nbe made shall be 48 months from the date of priority if applicable or 48 months from the\\ndate of filing of application. Now this is the same rule as you saw in 24B(1)(i), but in this\\ncase it is specifically tied to section 5 2 applications and we are already mentioned that\\nsection 5(2) applications whereas, special sect of applications which were filed during\\nthe transitory period between 1995 and 2005 and the time period for making a request in\\nthose cases will run from the date of priority or from a 48 month period from the date of\\nfiling what this means? Here it does not say whichever is earlier what this means is that\\nyou could file the request for examination within a period of 48 months from the date of\\npriority, and in the case of a application that comes from a pharmaceutical company\\nhaving international operations it is quite likely that that application could have had an\\nearlier priority date based on an international application PCT has certain priority rules\\n 320  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 323}), Document(page_content='and the priority document that is filed for a PCT application could be much earlier than\\nthe  filing  of  the  application  in  India.  So,  the  priority  date  could  be  much  earlier\\nsometimes even before the application is actually taken up for examination.\\nSo, in this case there is no mention that the 48-month period could either be from the\\ndate of priority or from the date of filing there is no mention that it has to be the earlier\\npriority the earlier date. It if there is no statement whichever is earlier in this sub clause\\nwhereas, in the earlier one we found that there was a statement whichever is earlier\\nwhich gives the liberty to the applicant to file the request for examination either within\\nthe 48 month period from the date of priority which is likely to be different from the date\\nof filing because in most cases in 5(2), you will have an application that is filed abroad\\nand the Indian application is in follow up application based on an earlier filing. So, in the\\ncase of international application where there is an earlier filing the date of priority will\\ndefinitely be different from the date of filing.\\nSo, in this case the liberty is given to the applicant either to choose the 48-month period\\nfrom the date of priority or to choose the 48-month period from the date of filing the\\napplication and there is no mandate in this provision that it has to be the earlier one\\nunlike 24B(1)(i). 11B(4) states that in case the applicant or any interested person does\\nnot make a request for a examination for the application for a patent within the period\\nspecified in subsection one or subsection 3 the application shall be treated as withdrawn\\nby the applicant.\\nNow, here is the proof that the patent office will not do anything unless a request for\\napplication sorry the patent office will not do anything unless a request for examination\\nis filed. So, 11B(4) tells us unless a request for examination is done the patent office will\\nnot look into the application, rather the application will be treated as withdrawn by the\\napplicant. Now there are two things that we need to explain at this point the patent office\\nprocedures are structured in such a way that the burden of doing something is always\\nshifted to the applicant if the applicant does not do certain actions then the patent office\\nwill  deemed  that  as  the  patent  office  will  deem  that  in  action  by the  applicant  as\\nsomething which amounts to a withdrawal or something which amounts to abandoning\\nthe application.\\n 321  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 324}), Document(page_content='So, the in the life of a patent starting with the filing of a patent application there are\\nvarious timelines which an application has to keep and there are various things then\\napplicant  has  to do, and when the  applicant  does not keep the timeline  or do that\\nparticular action the patent office will presume that the patentee or the patent applicant is\\nnot interested in perusing the application. This is largely done because patents are filed in\\nmost cases where the technology covered by the patent is in it is initial or the nascent\\nphase. There will be occasions where a patent is filed or a provisional application is filed\\nand later work done on that particular area would deem that it is not a viable invention or\\nit is not cost effective to come out with invention or the business interest of the applicant\\ncould change for multiple reasons the patent applicant may not want to pursue a patent\\napplication, and because of it is nature you have to file it early in time further research or\\nfurther r n d may or further changes in the business environment may lead the patent\\napplicant to give up the inventions.\\nSo, the patent office is structured in a way in which the patent applicant needs to take\\ncertain action, feeling which the default position will be that the patent will be regarded\\nas abandoned or it will be deemed as or treated as withdrawn. So, 11B(4) gives you one\\ninstance there are many other instances which we will see as we go by gives you one\\ninstance, where the inaction of the patent applicant resells in the withdrawal of the\\napplication. If you actually see the patent app withdrawal can be seen as a conscious act\\nyou do something withdrawal can be seen like you go to the ATM and with draw the\\nmoney it is a conscious act you do something, but here it is treated as withdrawn by your\\ninaction because a timeline was given for you to do certain things and you saw the\\ntimeline is largely 48 months from either the priority date or the date of filing and if you\\ndo did not do that thing of making a request, paying the required fee the patent office will\\nregard that you have withdrawn the application that is the first thing.\\nThe second thing that why is it that the patent office requires a request for examination to\\nbe filed by the applicant or an interested person because if you look at every other thing\\nthat needs to be done for a patent application to move forward are things which the\\napplicant needs to do. The applicants needs to file it the applicant needs to prosecute it\\nwhen  objections  comes  from  the  patent  office  what  we  call  the  first  statement  of\\nobjections or the first examination report as it was earlier called the applicant needs to\\naddress it if there is a hearing called for by the patent controller under section 14, the\\n 322  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 325}), Document(page_content='applicant needs to go there and address for the hearing or the applicant needs to send his\\nrepresentative all these things are pegged on the applicant.\\nWhy request for examination alone is pegged on the applicant or other interested person\\nthey could be multiple explanations for this, but one reason that we can find is that the\\nduty  one  reason  that  we  can  find  is  that  request  for  examination  is  what  sets  an\\napplication in to it is examination mode till the request is not filed the application is not\\nexamined. So, by enabling an interested person to file a request for examination an\\ninterested person could also be a competitor, the patent office gives the interested person\\nthe ability or the power to start the process of prosecution.\\nSo, if there is a patent pending over a matter which can affect the interest of a competitor\\nthe competitor could take a request for examination so that the application is examined\\nand either granted or dismissed. So, the uncertainty on a pending application could be\\nresolved by taking a request for examination or by making the request because it is the\\nrequest that sets the prosecution in motion if the request is not happen the prosecution\\ndoes not happen at all. With regard to the second point interested person is understood as\\na person who could be a competitor we get that from the language of section 25(2) which\\ntalks about post grant opposition or opposition after the grant where it is mentioned that\\nat any time after the grant of a patent, but before the expiry of a period of one year from\\nthe date of publication of grant of a patent any person interested may give notice of\\nopposing the patent it is goes on continuous.\\nSo, any person interested under the act could mean a person who has a competitive\\ninterest. So, a patent can be opposed by a person who has a competitive interest and that\\nperson could be entitled to make the request for examination under 11B(1) as we saw. If\\nyou look at form 18, if the request for examination is made by an interested person then\\nthe interested person is required to give evidence of interest in the application for the\\npatent. Now in this context you could also assume that an interested person could be a\\nfurther assignee of the patent, a person who had applied it the applicant assigned it later\\non to another party and that party now becomes the interested person or it could be a\\nperson who has an interest in the application we will find that you could transfer an\\ninterest in the application as you can transfer an interest in the patent, and because of the\\ninterest in the application the person now wants the application to proceed.\\n 323  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 326}), Document(page_content='So, a person interested could be understood as a person who has a competing interest and\\nalso who has an interest in the application itself interest could be by a future assignment\\nor it could be say by the interest that is accrued through a legal process see there was a\\ncompany which went into bankruptcy and it was later acquired by another company.

Now section 11A(3) tells us that you could withdraw an application\\n3 months before the expiry of the 18-month period, how do you do that? though form 29\\nis mentioned in the context of 11B(4). The wording in form in 11B(4)(i) tells us that it is\\n 324  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 327}), Document(page_content='broad enough to cover any withdrawal at any time before the grant.

When we come to section 35, we will see that once the secrecy direction is\\nmade it can either be renewed or it can be revoked.\\nSo, if it is renewed after a period of time then it continues to be existed or if it is revoked\\nthen the request for examination has to be made within the prescribed period. Now this\\nprescribed period is also mentioned in rule 24B. Rule 24B(1)(iii) it is again try to\\nunderstand this the request for examination as a rule has to be made within 48 months,\\nwhen the 48 months starts is what you need to understand it starts from the priority date\\nif there is a priority document, it may start from the date of filing the application if that is\\nthe first disclosure, it may start from the date of revocation of the secrecy direction that is\\nwhat is mentioned in 24B(1)(iii).\\nThe request for examination under subsection 4 of section 11B shall be made within\\n48 months from the date of priority or from the date of filing the application or within\\n6 months from the date of revocation of the secrecy direction whichever is later. So, the\\ndefault provision is 48 months from the date of priority or from the date of publication\\ndate of filing, where a secrecy direction is issued 6 months from the date of revocation of\\nthe secrecy direction. So, that is the third element whichever is later.\\nNow, if the secrecy direction continues beyond the 48-month period then it has to be      6\\nmonths from the revocation of the secrecy direction. So, after the secrecy direction is\\nrevoked within 6 months you need to make the request for examination. So, 24B(1)(iii)\\ncontinues the same rule as mentioned in 24B(1)(i) which is a request for examination of\\nan application shall be made within 48-month period, and that period can start either\\nfrom the priority date or from the date of filing. If there is a secrecy direction and if it is\\nit goes beyond this period then when the secrecy direction is revoked whenever it is\\nrevoked within 6 months you can take the request for examination.\\nNow, though 11B does not talk about divisional application, rule 24B has also provided\\nfor the other cases where the timeline for making a request for examination can change\\n 325  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 328}), Document(page_content='that is mentioned in rule 24B(1)(iv).

Now if a question is asked what is the instance in\\nwhich a form 18 has to be filed mandatorily along with form one then this is the case,\\nbecause it clearly says the further application shall have to be accompanied by a request\\nfor examination and request for examination is filed under form 18 and the application\\nitself is filed under form 1.\\nSo, this is the only scenario where a form 18 and form 1 has to be optional you could file\\nit in an due course you in an normal case you could file it is optional for you to file the\\nform 18 along with form 1, but in this case it has to be mandatorily filed along the form\\n18 has to be filed with form 1 and the reason being the parent application because this\\nbeing a divisional the parent application has already been referred for a examination.\\nOnce this happens the further application which is the divisional shall be published\\nwithin  one month  and referred  to the  examiner  meaning  the  examiner  was  already\\nexamining the parent application within one month from the date of such publication.

So, within two months their divisional will now end up\\nbefore the examiner, for examination along with the parent application. So, that is you\\nobjective. So, this is the only case where form 18 has to be filed along with form 1\\nmandatorily, in every other case you could file a form 18 with form 1 that is optional. So,\\nthis is the only case where the law mandates you to file a form 18 and form 1 together.\\nNow,  coming  back  to  24B(2),  24B(2)  tells  us  what  happens  after  a  request  for\\nexamination is filed. Now a rule 24B(1) gave the various timelines for filing the request\\nnow the request is filed what happens now this is how the prosecution moves forward.\\nOnce the request is filed the controller shall refer the applications specification and the\\nother documents what is called the file, the file will have all it is its one file shall refer\\nthe application specification and the other documents related thereto to the examiner.\\n 328  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 331}), Document(page_content='Now, this is something which the controller passes there is a direction that upon the\\nrequest for examination the controller shall refer the application to an examiner.

This is because priority preservation is one thing\\npreserving the priority by going to the parent office is one thing and making a request for\\nexamination and standing in the queue of the examination is another thing. So, the patent\\ncontroller will refer the matters based on the order in which the request for examination\\nwas filed, and not in the order in which the patent applications where filed.\\nNow, the only exception to this rule that the patent controller shall refer the matters for\\nexamination  in  the  order  in which  the  request  for  examination  is  filed  is  a  matter\\npertaining to divisional application. It is mentioned provided that in case of a further\\napplication filed under section 16 which means a divisional application filed based on a\\nparent, the order of reference of such application shall be the same as that of the first\\nmentioned application the divisional which is also called a child is always tied to the\\nparent. So, the divisional because it is tied to the parent will get into the priority the\\ndivisional because it is tied to the patent will be examined along with the parent. So, it\\njust says that the normal rule is that the order in which applications will be examined will\\nbe based on the filing of request for divisional alone because they are tied to the parent it\\nwill be the date on which the request for examining the patent was filed.\\nSo, as long as it is possible to club divisional application with its parent it will be\\nexamined with the parent.

Now we saw\\nthat the controller refers the application to the examiner that is the process once a request\\nfor examination is made the controller refers the application to the examiner at that point\\nthe examiner begins to examine the application that is mentioned in section 12.\\n(Refer Slide Time: 40:26)\\n 331  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 334}), Document(page_content='Now, let us take section 12 requests for examination, we had seen in section 11B that a\\nrequest for examination can be filed by the applicant or by an interested person the act\\nrefers to the person as any other interested person because the applicant is obviously, a\\nperson who is interested in the application. So, 11B tells us that there are two people who\\ncan initiate the request for an examination. Now the applicant’s side of the case is quite a\\nstraight forward case the applicant is the one who files the application. So, the applicant\\nshould have the right to initiate the request for examination the question arises why\\nshould an interested person also be given this right to make a request for examination;\\nbecause  an  interested  person  is  understood  under  the  act  as  a  person  who  has  a\\ncompeting interest because a section 2(1) defines an interested person the section 2(1(t)\\ndefines a person interested to include a person engaged in or in promoting research in the\\nsame field as that to which the invention relates.\\nNow, this is the definition of a person interested, whereas the language that is used in\\n11B is that of an interested person and these are language used is definitely a different\\none, and you  can compare  the language  with section  25(2) which is  on post grant\\nopposition. Section 25(2)  states that at any time after the grant of a patent, but before the\\nexpiry of a period of one year from the date of publication of the grant of a patent a\\nperson interested may give notice. So, there the terminology used is person interested\\nand in 11B if you see a 11B(3) and 11B(4) the language used there is interested person.\\nSo, in essence it could mean the same, but the language that comes in section 25(2) talks\\nabout a person interested whereas, 11B talks about an interested person. Now a person\\ninterested is clearly defined as the person who has a competing interest who is interested\\nin the invention and it is defined as the person who can who is engaged in or is in\\npromoting research in the same fields as to which the invention in relates.\\nSo, somebody who is interested in the same field may be a person who has a competing\\ninterest. So, and that is the reason why a person interested can initiate a post grant\\nopposition or an opposition after the grant interested person could be understood as a\\nperson who has an interest in the invention it need not be a competing interest you could\\nconstrue it to be a competing interest, but in this case we can give an explanation that a\\nperson interested is different from an interested person, because when we look at the\\ncorresponding form which is form 18. In clause 3 of form 18 the interested person has to\\nmake  a  statement.  We  the  interested  person  requires  for  the  examination  of  the\\n 332  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 335}), Document(page_content='application number so and so, dated so and so, filed by the applicant so and so titled. So,\\nand so, under section 12 and 13 of the Act. As an evidence of my or interest in the\\napplication for the patent following documents are submitted.\\nSo, here the interest is in the application it is not in the research area or it is not in the\\nfield. So, here we can understand an interested person as being some way connected to\\nthe invention itself who has some kind of an interest may be, he could be a beneficiary of\\nthe technology, maybe it could be an investor in to the invested into the technology a\\nperson who finances the invention cannot have any rights of an applicant, unless they\\nhave taken an assignment from the inventor. So, somebody who has an interest who\\nwants this application to be to move quickly could be understood or the creditor of a\\ncompany, the company is about to get into bankruptcy and they want to expedite the\\napplications or the company is already in to bankruptcy proceeding it is being taken over\\nthe company has been taken over by a liquidator or an administrator.\\nSo, in all these cases the person is interested in the invention in a positive way, not as a\\ncompetitor. So, when the  person is  interested  in a  positive  way that  person has  to\\ndemonstrate by evidence submit documents to show why he is an interested person. So,\\nthis we understand as a demonstration of interest in proceeding with the application. So,\\nwe understand the language in 11B that an interested person we understand that in the\\nlight of form 18 where document or evidence of interest has to be demonstrated and we\\nunderstand that as an interest in the application.\\nNow, there is another interpretation you could give because when an application is filed\\nand an application does not move forward unless a request for examination is made. if a\\nparty wants to proceed with an opposition if a party wants to proceed with a pre grant\\nopposition then that party that files a pre grant opposition will not be able to proceed\\nwith  the  opposition  unless  a  request  for  examination  is  filed  because  unless  the\\napplication is examined the opposition proceedings will not be considered because in the\\nsequence of events if you see the language of section 43 only when the application is\\nmade ready for a grant. 43 says that where the application is found to be in order for\\ngrant when the application is found to be in order for a grant then the controller will see\\nwhether there are any objections for not granting the application. He can look at whether\\nthe application has not been refused by the controller by virtue of any of the power\\n 333  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 336}), Document(page_content='vested by him or the application has not been found to be in contravention of any of the\\nprovisions of the act.\\nNow, when there are no objections on the application only then the controller grants the\\napplication. In practice we know that once the examination process is over and the\\napplication is found ready to be in order for a grant then that the controller will look at\\nwhether there are any pending pre-grant oppositions. So, pre-grant opposition in practice\\nis considered after the prosecution process is over, because whatever the office has to do\\nthe office has done it the applicant has got over all the objections raised by the office that\\nis the controller and it is found to be in order for a grant there is nothing that stops the\\napplication from being ordered. At that point the software system now, we will raise a\\nthing that you cannot grant this because there is a pre-grant opposition pending either\\none or multiple then it is then that the controller starts hearing the pre-grant opposition.\\nNow, this is how the practice is set and if you look at various orders of the controller on\\npre-grant opposition you will understand that the FER was filed, objections to the FER\\nwere  met  and  only  then  the  pre-grant  opposition  was  considered.  So,  pre-grant\\nopposition in practice is not considered while the applicant is prosecuting the patent. In\\nIndia we do not have a case where the copy of the pre grant opposition is sent along with\\nthe FER that is now the case here the FER is sent based on a report of the examiner the\\napplicant gives responses to the FER that happens back and forth, then it reaches a point\\nif there are objections under 14 and 15, it is overcome and the controller is in claimed the\\ngrant the patent only then he looks at the whether there is a pre grant because if the\\ncontroller rejects the patent on his own using his powers of prosecution then there is no\\nneed to look into the pre grant at all because any way it is going to get rejected.\\nSo, there are many cases where including the case involving Gilead drug Sovaldi, where\\nthe controller at independently rejected the patent application even when there was a pre-\\ngrant opposition pending, he had independently rejected, but later on it came to be\\ngranted because of some other proceedings. But in a case where there is a pre-grant\\nopposition pending the controller will still try to address all the issues on his own before\\nhe looks into the pre-grant opposition. So, in every case a pre-grant opposition is taken\\nup for consideration in all the cases we can assume that the applicant has got over all the\\nobjections raised by the controller. So, that is the sequence of events controller raises\\n 334  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 337}), Document(page_content='objections  based on the examiner’s report the applicant gets over it only then they\\nconsider pre-grant. \\nSo, pre-grant is that is that is a way also to ensure that the work flows managed in a\\nbetter way rather than sending a pre grant objection in parallel, also sending the FER in\\nparallel just to find out that the FER has already raised and the patent will not get granted\\nnot just that, there are various cases where the applicant may abandoned the application\\nafter the FER is sent they will not reply back or they will not comply with the timeline\\nwithin  section  21,  if  you  do  not  do  with  in  something  with  in  a  timeline  it  is\\nautomatically deemed to be abandoned.\\nSo, the controller will allow all these things to pass, if the applicant is interested in still\\nprosecuting it, he gets over all the objections only then they will consider the pre-grant.\\nSo, the pre-grant is normally considered after the application is made ready for a grant.\\nSo, now, assume a case where there is a pre grant is filed and the application is spending\\nno request for examination you know that there is a 48 month period for you to file the\\nrequest for examination no request for examination is filed, but assume that the pre-grant\\nopponent is in a hurry he wants he is sure that this patent will get a revoked so he wants\\nto expedite it. In that case if the pre-grant opponent also is a person interested then he\\nmay file a request for an examination using form 18, but the only problem is the patent\\noffice will have to understand these two terms as one and the same a person interested\\nand interested person though there been used in different context, if the patent office\\nunderstands a person interested as an interested person.\\nThen we can say that a person interested can file a request for examination there is no\\nclarity on this, we have not seen any decisions of either the controller or the high quotes\\non this to say that a person interested and in interested person are one and the same. If we\\ntake that line it means that a person who has filed an opposition pre-grant can be find by\\nany person it need not be a person interested any person, but if that person has an interest\\nthen  that  person  can  actually  expedite  the  examination  by  taking  a  request  for\\nexamination. So, if the applicant wants to delay examination say he wants to take the\\nexamination  request  only  after  40  months  or  just  before  the  48-month  period,  an\\nopponent who has already filed a pre grant because pre grant can be filed by any person\\nincluding a person interested say a competitor files a pre grant the competitor can if this\\n 335  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 338}), Document(page_content='interpretation is allowed that a person interested and interested person as one and the\\nsame. \\nIn the English language they are one and the same if under the act also it is understood\\nthat the person interested and interested person are one and the same then a person who\\nhas filed a pre grant, can take an application to start the examination process because the\\nexamination sources only starts with the request for examination; because we saw that\\nthe queue for the examination is different from the queue of filing, filing is based on\\npriority date and you get the priority date based on filing, but what gets taken up for\\nexamination is completely different that is based on the date on which you took a request\\nfor examination.\\nSo, if you filed late, but you filed a request for an examination on the date of filing itself\\nand a request for publication, then your application will be published and it will take up\\nfor examination, your examination will be much quicker than the person who file before\\nyou, but waited for 48 months. So, we would understand this provision that an interested\\nperson in common English language an interested person and person interested means\\nthe same, but if you look at form 18 an interested person has to have an interest in the\\napplication that again is you  could say that an a opponent is also interested in the\\napplication  he  has  some  interest  business  interest  you  needs  to  show  through\\ndocumentation that he is interested. If you look at form seven which is the form that is\\nused for filing a post grant opposition there is no demonstration of interest or any\\ndocument that is required in the form does not say that whereas, in the statement of\\nopposition you have to demonstrate your interest in the statement, but the form does not\\nsay that whereas, in form 18 it asks you to demonstrate your interest.\\nSo, we understand this in two ways one it could be understood that an interested person\\nfor this purpose is different from a person interested going by the meaning, the other way\\nis to say that interested person and the person interested are one and the same because\\ngoing by the English language meaning. So, both these interpretations are possible and it\\nis possible to say based on the act that a person interested who files pre-grant opposition\\nbecause pre-grant opposition can be filed by any person. Assume that the any person is\\nalso a person interested who as an interest competing interest then it will be possible for\\nthat person to start the examination process, because he need not wait for 48 months and\\nhe can quicken the process because he has the pre-grant that is pending. \\n 336  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 339}), Document(page_content='So,  this  is  a  provision which  allows  a  person other  than  the  applicant  to  start  the\\nprosecution  because  we  know  that  prosecution  starts  only  when  a  request  for\\nexamination is made.

So, the examiner also gives\\nin report on the search it is a search report search on anticipation, and (d) any other\\nmatter which may be prescribed. So, the examiner has to look into these 4 things and\\nmake a report on these 4 things to the controller; and the report that the examiner makes\\nto the controller shall be confidential. Section 144 states that report of examiners to be\\nconfidential, the report of examiners to the controller under this act which is made under\\nthe sections 12 shall not be open to public inspection or be published by the controller,\\nand such reports shall not be liable to production or inspection in any legal proceeding\\n 339  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 342}), Document(page_content='unless the court certifies that the production and inspection is desirable in the interest of\\njustice and or to be allowed.\\nSo, the normal rule is that the report made by an examiner to the controller under section\\n12 is confidential, and this report is not the first examination report or the first statement\\nof objection; because based on this report the controller will issue the first statement of\\nobjection or the first examination report. So, it is easy to get miss led by the fact that the\\nexaminer’s report is the first examination report it is not so, the first examination report\\nis  issued  by the  controller  whereas,  what  is  issued  by the  examiner  is  an  internal\\ndocument  which  goes  to  the  controller  based  on  which  the  controller  mixes  first\\nexamination report.\\nSo, the first examination report is not the report made by the examiner to the controller,\\nrather it is a report that is issued by the controller and now it is called the first statement\\nof objections. Section 12(2) says  that the examiner to whom the application or the\\nspecification and other documents relating thereto are referred under sub section 1 shall\\nordinarily make the report to the controller within a period as may be prescribed.\\nNow, this is just the internal procedure, once the file or the specification the application\\nand the documents are referred to the examiner, the examiner has a time period within\\nwhich he shall make his report. The time period we will see will change based on the\\nnature of examination if the examination is an ordinary examination then there is a time\\nperiod for that if it is an expedited examination under 24C there is a different time period\\nfor that. So, we will just see the corresponding rules now.\\n 340  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 343}), Document(page_content='(Refer Slide Time: 07:12)\\nRule 24B(2) roman two the period within which the examiner shall make the report\\nunder section 12(2) shall ordinarily be one month, but not exceeding 3 months from the\\ndate of reference of the application to him by the controller.\\nSo, the examiner once the references are made by the controller has to make this report\\nwithin one month, but not exceeding 3 months.

Section 12 does not give a timeline for\\nthe controller making the reference to the examiner, it nearly states at the earliest. So, the\\nfirst thing that will happen after the request for the examination is made is that the\\ncontroller will refer the matter to the examiner what is the timeline for that? The act does\\nnot say any timeline it nearly says at the earliest. So, the controller mixes the reference to\\nthe examiner, once the examiner receives the reference and the files the examiner shall\\nfile is report between 1 to 3 months.

Rule\\n24B(3) tells us that the first statement of objections along with any document as may be\\na required shall be issued by the controller to the applicant or his authorized agent within\\none month from the date of disposal of the report of the examiner by the controller.\\nSo, the report of the examiner has to be disposed of within one month of receiving it, and\\nwithin 1 month from the date of disposal the controller shall issue the statement of\\nobjection the first statement of objection, which was earlier called the first examination\\nreport it is now called the first statement of objection. So, the controller shall issue the\\nfirst statement of objection, within 1 month of disposing of the report of the examiner\\nand this is issued to the applicant or the authorized agent of the applicant.\\nSo,  now  we  are  able  to  see  the  timelines  request  for  examination  is  made  within\\n48 months of the date of priority or from the date of filing the application in a normal\\ncase, once the request for the examination is made the controller at the earliest possible\\ntime refers it to and the examiner now there is no timeline mentioned on the act it is just\\nset at the earliest occasion it is not time is not prescribed. So, that is one part in the\\nprosecution where there is no prescribed time, where the controller refers the application\\nto the examiner there is no time just mentioned at the earliest.\\n 342  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 345}), Document(page_content='Once it is referred to the examiner the examiner within a period between 1 to 3 months\\nshall file his report back to the controller, when the controller receives the report within\\n1-month, he shall dispose the report, and from 1-month of disposing the report the\\ncontroller shall issue the first statement of objections to the applicant or the agent of the\\napplicant. So, this gives you the timeline of what happens once a request for examination\\nis filed. Sub rule 3 of rule 24B states that provided that where a request for examination\\nwas filed by a person interested only an intimation of such examination may be sent to\\nthe person interested.\\nNow, we at pointed this out as an anomaly a person interested does not do anything in\\nprosecution except that he gets the power to initiate the examination by filing a request\\nfor examination. We had already pointed this out to you that the person interested could\\nbe a person who has a competitive interest or in affirming interest or in interest in the\\npatent itself either has a person who acquires an interest later on, and when he makes a\\nrequest for examination only an intimation of such examination is sent to the person\\ninterested.\\nThe first statement of objection is not sent to the person interested, only an intimation is\\nsent. So, this clearly states that the applicant is still the person who gets to drive the\\nexamination process, because if the applicant does not do assume that the first statement\\nof objection has issued and the applicant does not proceed with it, he does not reply to\\nthe  first  statement  of  the  objection  within  the  timeline  prescribe  again  the  patent\\napplication will be dream deemed to have been abundant. \\nSo, though one of the reasons for giving the right to initiate an examination or to initiate\\nor file the request for examination could be that, open failure to file the request for\\nexamination the application will be treated as withdrawn by the applicant. Where has\\nwhen a request for examination is filed either by the applicant or by an interested person,\\nand  then  the  applicant  fails  to  respond  to  the  first  statement  of  the  objections  the\\napplication will be now treated as something that I have been deemed to be abundant.\\nSo, the law uses 2 different phrases where there is inaction by the applicant in that the\\napplicant does not make a request for examination, the law treats the application as\\nwithdrawn  by  the  applicant.  Whereas,  if  the  examination  proceeds  and  the  first\\nexamination report is file by the applicant, and the first examination report or the first\\n 343  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 346}), Document(page_content='statement of objection is filed by the controller the applicant does not respond to that\\nthen the applicant is deemed to have been abundant. Now we get this from the language\\nof section 21 and when we deal with section 21, we will see the difference between\\ninstances where something is deemed to be withdrawn and instances were something is\\ndeemed to be abandoned.\\n24B(4) states that a reply to the first statement of objection then subsequent reply if any\\nshall be proceeded; section 24B(4) states that a reply to the first statement of objections\\nand subsequent reply if any shall be processed in the ordered in which such reply is\\nreceived,  because  patent  prosecution  is  a  process  which  happens  for  multiple\\napplications at the same time before the patent office, the patent office will only deal\\nwith things in the order in which the reply is received.\\nSo, your date of filing the application your date of filing the request for examination are\\nnot relevant when it comes to replying to the first statement of the objections. So,\\nwhenever the reply is it will be in shall be processed in the order in which the reply is\\nreceived. For instance, if the applicant files reply to the first statement of objections\\nwithin a week’s time of receiving the objections this application will move forward based\\non the reply received. If the applicant prolongs the reply and waits till the expiry of the\\ntill 1 week before the expiry of the period and then files it then it will be processed in the\\norder in which the reply is received.\\nSo, again the phase of prosecution is determined by the action of the applicant, if the\\napplicant moves quickly the prosecution is likely to move faster if the applicant moves\\nslowly then the prosecution will move in the order in which the reply was received. So,\\nagain the burden of moving the prosecution quickly is partly shifted on the applicant.\\nSub rule 5 says that the time for putting an application in order for grant under section 21\\nshall be 6 months from the date on which the first statement of objection is issued to the\\napplicant to comply with the requirements, within 6 months of the first statement of the\\nobjection being issued the applicant has to comply with the requirements.\\nNow, if the 6 month period is set on stone in the sense that if you do not reply within this\\nperiod or if you reply within this period and your is not perfect will you get an additional\\nperiod beyond 6 months or in other words can the 6 months period we understood as a\\n 344  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 347}), Document(page_content='6 month period for a reply for the first statement of objection such that any further\\nstatement of objection follows through it can go beyond the 6 month period.\\nNow there are two ways to look at it, if you look at the next rule that is rule 24C which\\ntalks about expedited examination and compared it with this provision you may get an\\nimpression that this is not open ended timeline the time for putting the application for\\ngrant under section 21 shall be 6 month from the date, on which the first exam statement\\nof objection is issued to the applicant.\\nNow, when I say it is an open timeline it could be construed as you should need to\\nrespond to the first statement of objection within 6 months, and any further responses can\\nhave it is own timeline. It is not that all the objections have to be complied within the\\n6-month period because we could get this impression when we look at the language used\\nin the next rule and we will compare that when we come to expedited examination in\\n24C. So, the 6 month period can be understood as the 6 months within which you\\nrespond to the first statement of objection, and if there are further objections based on\\nthat it could be argued that you can go beyond the 6 month period to address those issues\\nit is a matter of argument the other way in which this provision can be interpreted is that\\nevery objection that comes out of the first statement of the objection has to be addressed\\nwithin the first 6 months of the date on which the first statement of objection is issued.\\n(Refer Slide Time: 19:39)\\n 345  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 348}), Document(page_content='There will be a strict interpretation of the provision, and patent appliance are likely to\\nhave issues in prosecuting applications is a strict application is a strict interpretation of\\nthis provision is applied. 24B(6) tells that the time for putting the application for grant\\nunder section 21 as prescribed in sub rule 4 may be further extended to a period of\\n3 month, on a request in form 4. Form 4 is a general form used for any extension of time\\nalong with the prescribe fee made to the controller before the expiry of the period under\\nsub rule 4.\\nNow, you could extend the time for filing a reply which is normally 6 months, before the\\nexpiry of the 6 months provided you make a request for extension of time under form 4\\nyou can seek an additional 3 months. So, 6 plus 3 whether you can file further form 4\\none after the other and extend the timeline is debatable, but the sub rule 6 tells us that\\nbefore the 6 month period expires, you could file a further extension of 3 months. \\nSo, on paper you could say that prosecution the entire process of objections of replying\\nto the first statement of objection has to be complied within a maximum of 9 month you\\ncould say this, you could say this by an interpretation of rule sub rules 5 sub rule 4, 5 and\\n6 put together you could say that the patent applicant has to respond to all the objections\\nthat have come in the first statement of objection within a period of 9 months, and\\nrecently we had the minister of commerce make a statement that the applications will be\\nexamined within a smaller time frame then it was done before and we should be able to\\nhave grants within 18 months of the start of the prosecution process.\\nSo, there was a policy which the Indian patent office’s, now moving towards to expedite\\nthe grants. So, this provision could be seen in line that if the applicant can only take time\\nof up to 9 months for addressing the first statement of objections then.

Again,  this  is  a  request  for  an  expedited\\nexamination namely; (a) that India has been indicated as the competent international\\nsearching authority or elected as the international preliminary examinate authority in the\\ncorresponding international application or the applicant is a startup; startup is defined in\\nthe rules, startup has special status in the first schedule, first schedule is the schedule\\nwhich describes the fees. Startups are entitled to fees at the same level as individuals. So,\\nthis is a privilege that is given to startups. Startups will be treated on the same fees\\nstructure as individuals that are natural persons. So, natural persons and startups are now\\ntogether grouped as one category for the purposes of living fees.\\nSo, you can make the request for an expedited examination under rule 24C using form 18\\nA provided you have chosen India as the competent international searching authority or\\nelected the international preliminary examination, examining authority in India for the\\ncorresponding international application.

Now by\\nthis they created Indian international searching authority that is rule 19A introduced the\\ninternational searching authority in India and rule 19F created the Indian international\\npreliminary  examining  authority.  So,  these  2  authorities  we  created  by  the  patent\\namendment rules 2013.\\nSo, the first category pertains to cases where an applicant has filed an international\\napplication  and  has  chosen  India  as  the  international  searching  authority  or  the\\ninternational preliminary examining authority and these changes by where introduced\\ninto the patent rules by the amendment in patents amendments rules 2013; the 2013\\namendments  made  the  Indian  international  searching  authority  and  the  Indian\\ninternational preliminary examining authority came into been by that amendment.\\nSo, that is the first category for you to make a request for an expedited examination you\\nneed  to  file  an  international  application  in  the  absence  of  filing  an  international\\napplication category a will not be open to an applicant. So, its mandatory to while\\nseeking before filing form 18A that you have first filed an international application and\\nhave chosen India as the either the ISA the international searching authority or the IPEA\\ninternational preliminary examining authority form 18A can only be filed by an entity\\nother than a natural person or a startup provided there is an international application\\nemplace.\\nSo, the first category pertains to an applicant who was already made an international\\napplication in India and has chosen India as the ISA or the IPEA. The second category its\\nquite simple if the applicant is a startup if the applicant is a startup as defined under the\\npatent rules then the applicant can make a request for an expedited examination.

So, again these are with regard to what is significant again, because the\\nentity will now have to form 28, it will be reasonable for us to expect that the controller\\nwill be taking a call on that explanation 5 the reference rate of foreign currency of the\\nReserve Bank of India shall reveal.\\nNow if there is a startup which is a foreign entity or entity does has some operation in a\\nforeign country foreign entities still will have to be registered under one of these acts\\nbecause that is when it will be regarded as an entity, but if the turnover is in say in\\ndollars in US dollars then the reference rate for foreign currency of the Reserve Bank of\\nIndia will apply to see whether they are exceeded the 25 crore turnover mark.

Now this has to be filled.\\nSo, going back to rule 24C(2) tells the instances where you could convert an existing\\nrequest for examination to a expedited request by paying the relevant fees and that is\\ndone by form 18A because form 18 is already filed.\\n(Refer Slide Time: 27:52)\\n 360  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 363}), Document(page_content='In that case sub rule 3 states that except where the applications already been published\\nunder sub section 2 of section eleven a or a request for publication under rule 24A has\\nalready been filed a request for expedited examination shall be accompanied by a request\\nfor publication under rule 24A. Now this simply means when you file form 18 A if you\\nhave not already filed form 9 you have to file it along with form 9 is the request for\\npublication.\\nNow, the idea as why would you make an expedited request for examination if your\\napplication itself is not published because if your application is not published there is no\\nway the patent office is going to examine your application. So, it becomes necessary for\\nthe applicant to take form 9 if he has not already done it along with form 18A. So, sub\\nrule 3 says that when you are making a request under form 18A you have to accompany\\nit with form 9 which is a request for publication.\\nNow, the 2 cases where you will not do that are its quite obvious the 2 cases where you\\nwill not do that is the application is already published there is no need to then take form\\n9 or the form 9 is already filed.

So, though you have\\n 361  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 364}), Document(page_content='taken a request for expedited examination if you do not comply with the requirements in\\nthe rule then it will proceed as a normal request for examination under 24 B.\\nUnderstand that  24B  is  for the  normal  we do not say normal  it  is  the request  for\\nexamination the ordinary one 24C is the expedited request if your form 18A does not\\nsatisfy the requirements under the rule then it will proceed as a normal examination the\\ndate will remain the same because the date of filing the form 18A.

So, what is the controller would investigate or would\\nlook at is the date on which the request was made the date on which the request was\\nmade  if  the  startup  filed  within  the  definition  of  a  startup  that  is  all  that  matters\\nsubsequently as the application gets examined if the startup loses its status that should\\nnot be a ground for questioning the status of the startup sub rule 6 states that once the\\nreference is made to the examiner the period within which the examiner shall make the\\nreport under subsection 2 of 12 shall ordinarily be one month, but not exceeding 2\\nmonths from the date of reference of the application to him by the controller.\\nWe saw that in rule 24B it was one month not exceeding 3 months. So, in this case they\\nhave cut down by another month. So, it is one month, but not exceeding 2 months, so,\\nthe examiner has a maximum of 2 months to give the report, whereas in 24B he has\\n3 months sub rule 7 states that the period within which the controller shall dispose of the\\nreport of the examiner shall be 1 month from the date of received of such report by the\\ncontroller  this  remains  the  same  in  24B  and  24C  sub  rule  eight  states  that  a  first\\nstatement of objections along with any document if required shall be issued by the\\ncontroller  to the applicant or his authorized  agent within 15 days  from the date of\\ndisposal of the report of the examiner by the controller.\\nNow, in 24B that was one month that is now been reduced to 15 days.

So, the 6 + 3 formula that we saw\\nin 24B also applies here sub rule 12 is important it Is important for us to understand 24B\\nitself because this throws light on a timeline which is not there in 24B. So, we will look\\nat this and we will go back to 24B.\\nSub rule 12 states that the controller shall dispose of the application within a period of\\n3 months from the date of received of last reply to the first statement of objection or\\nwithin a period of 3 months from the last date to put the application in order for grant\\nunder section 21 of the act whichever is earlier provided that this time limit shall not be\\napplicable in the case of pre-grant opposition.

So, that is its where the sub rule 12\\nbecomes important for us in understanding the timeline in 24 B. 24 B which is the case\\nof a normal request for examination being filed there is no mandate to dispose the\\napplication within 3 months from the receipt of the last reply whereas, in an expedited\\nexamination the controller has been given that mandate.\\nEither it is 3 months from the date of receipt for the last reply or within a period of\\n3 months from the last date to put the application in order for grant under section 21 of\\nthe act. So, within 3 months  from the last date to put the application  in order the\\ncontroller has to dispose the application again this provision to completely dispose the\\napplication is not there in rule 24B it also factors the fact that if a pre-grant opposition is\\nfiled then the controller cannot dispose the application till the pre-grant opposition is\\ndisposed off.\\nSo, this timeline will not apply or you may not be able to get an expedited examination\\ndone if there is a pending pre-grant opposition. So, you could say that one way an\\nexpedited examination can be frustrated is when a pre-grant opposition is filed, because\\nthen the time line need not be an expedited timeline because the controller will be bound\\nto dispose the pre-grant opposition before the application is disposed.\\nSub rule 13 states that notwithstanding anything contained in this rule the controller may\\nlimit the number of requests for expedited examination to be received during the year by\\nway of notice to be published in the official journal. Now the controller can make a\\nstatement in the official journal that in any given year they will be receiving only X\\nnumber of expedited applications. So, anything that goes beyond that the controller can\\nsay will be treated as an ordinary request for examination.\\nNow, this is again to check the workload of the patent office. So, the patent office should\\nnot be burdened with a more stringent timeline and as you saw in sub rule 12 the\\ncontroller  has to dispose the application  within 3 months.

(a) talks about lack of\\nnovelty by the fact that the invention is anticipated by a publication before the date of\\nfiling of applicant’s complete specification. Now we had already seen the date of filing is\\nnormally considered as the priority date. The date of filing is normally considered as the\\npriority date.\\nThe priority date can move to an earlier point and time if there is a priority document\\nsay, a provisional specification in which there is a disclosure made and a claimer filed at\\na later point and time. Any publication before the date of priority of the matter contained\\nin a claim of a specification can anticipate the invention. Anticipation is described as the\\ndisclosure of an invention before the date of priority or before the filing date.\\nLet us assume that, priority in the default case is the date of filing. So, anticipation is a\\npublication of the matter covered in the claim before the date of filing the application. If\\n 369  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 372}), Document(page_content='the day on which you filed your application, the day on which you filed your application\\nthe law requires the invention to be novel, then invention to be new or novel. The test of\\nnovelty requires the invention to have not been anticipated by any publication before. (a)\\ntells us that if there is any publication before the date of filing, that could amount to\\nanticipation or that could kill the novelty of an invention, provided what is claimed in the\\napplication was covered by that document by that publication.\\nNow the language here is that whether the invention so far as claimed in the claim of the\\ncomplete specification has been anticipated by publication. And what is cut off line\\nthere? Before the date of filing the complete specification in any specification filed in\\npursuance of an application of patent made in India and dated on or after the 1st of\\nJanuary 1912. So, any claim made in any specification filed in India. So, it is India’s\\nspecific, after the 1st of January 1912.\\nNow the 1st of January 1912 was the time when the 1911 act came into being. So, that\\nwas the start of the patent regime in India. So, any claim that was filed in the Indian\\npatent  office,  would anticipate  an  invention  if what  is  claimed  in  that  invention  is\\ncovered by the earlier publication.\\nSo, we will look at (b) and then we will look at the definition of new invention so that\\nthe concept of anticipation and lack of novelty is much clearer. (b) states that is claimed\\nin any claim of any other complete specification published on or after the date of filing\\nthe applicants’ complete specification, being a specification filed in pursuance of an\\napplication for a patent made in India and dated before or claiming the priority date\\nearlier than that date.\\nNow A considers a scenario where any specification filed in India after 1912, but before\\nthe date of filing of the applicant’s complete specification can be a subject matter of\\nanticipation,  anything  that  is  filed  in  India  let  us  forget  1912  as  a  timeline.  Any\\napplication filed in an Indian patent office because, that is when the 1911 act was the first\\nformal patent act for India.\\nSo, the patent office everything was created with that. So, before that we had some\\nexecutive orders. So, any patent filed in India before the date of filing can anticipate an\\ninvention. So, the examiner is going to check on all the specifications filed in India\\nbefore the date on which the applicant’s specification was made to see, whether what is\\n 370  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 373}), Document(page_content='claimed by the applicant has been claimed before. So, anticipation is a check to see\\nwhether what is been claimed in the applicant’s complete specification was covered by a\\npublication of any specification filed in India. So, the timeline is 1912 because, that is\\nwhen the Indian patent regime started. (b) talks about what is not covered in (a).\\nNow let us assume an application was filed on 1st January 2017. So, as per (a) the\\nexaminer has to look at every specification that was published before the date of filing\\nwhich was one day before 1st January 2017. That is from December 31st 2016 onwards\\nthe  controller  can  look  at  all  the  specifications  filed  in  India  before  that  day, the\\ncontroller can check to see what is claimed in this application whether it was claimed\\nbefore, whether it was anticipated by the publication which happened before.\\nSo, what the controller will do? As per (a) is to look at all the documents before Jan 1st\\n2017 filed before the patent office in India. In (b) the controller will look at documents\\npublished on or after the date of filing the applicant’s complete specification. Now in (a)\\nonly the documents before the date of filing will be considered. In b, the documents\\nwhich are published on or after the  date of filing  the complete  applicant  complete\\nspecification. In (b) the examiner will look at documents filed on Jan 1st 2017 or after\\nJan 1st 2017 this is the publication in pursuance of an application made for a patent term\\nmade in India and dated before or claiming the priority date earlier than that date. The\\nonly condition is though the publication happens after Jan 1st the priority date should\\nhave been earlier than that date.\\nSo, which simply tells us that the controller can look at a document which is published\\nafter the filing of the applicant’s complete specification, if it is priority is before the\\napplicant’s complete specification. Because, still there will be a case of anticipation. So,\\nanticipation can sometime happen when applications are pending. Say, a person files an\\napplication on Jan 1st, and other person files an application on Feb 1st.\\nSo, we will not know unless these publications are published, we will not know. So, once\\nthe Jan 1st application gets published then that can be because the priority date is earlier\\nit can be used for questioning the novelty of the latter filed complete specification. So, in\\n(b) the examiner is going to look at any complete specification published on or after the\\ndate of filing of the applicant’s complete specification.

Now  the  only  requirement  in  (b)  is  that  though  the  document  was\\npublished late afterwards after the filing of the applicant’s complete specification, the\\npriority should have been earlier to the applicant’s complete specification.\\nSo, the report on (a) and (b) will cover both publication before the date of filing and\\npublications after the date of filing, but in the case of publication after the date of filing\\nthe controller will see whether the priority was an earlier priority.\\n(Refer Slide Time: 11:32)\\nNow, the examiner shall in addition to making such investigation for the purpose of\\nascertaining whether the inventions so far as has claimed in any claim of the complete\\nspecification, has been anticipated by publication in India or elsewhere in any document\\nother than those mentioned in subsection one before the date of filing of the applicant’s\\ncomplete specification.\\nNow in subsection 1 we were only talking about complete specifications. We were\\ntalking about complete specification filed in India before the date of the applicant’s\\ncomplete specification, and we were also looking at complete specifications filed in India\\nafter the date of the filing of the applicant’s complete specification provided it as a earlier\\npriority. 2 talks about every other document; in a section subsection 1 deals with what we\\ncall cases of prior claiming. A claim that was made before anticipates a latter claim, this\\nis called prior claiming. 2 covers prior publication: publication can be in a claim, it could\\nbe also in a document other than a claim. If there is research article or a scientific\\n 372  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 375}), Document(page_content='literature which discloses this invention then, that may not be a case of prior claiming\\nbecause, the discloser not an earlier claim of a complete specification rather the discloser\\nwas in a prior publication.\\nSo, this is a kind of anticipation. Anticipation has different categories this is anticipation\\nby a prior publication. So, 2 captures everything else that other than what one pertains to.\\n1 covers only complete specifications which means the claim has to be disclosed in an\\nearlier claim. So, 1 talk about mapping claims you look at the claim as filed by the\\napplicant and look for an earlier claim and try to see whether the claims are one and the\\nsame or similar, and whether one claim could have anticipated the other. 2 talks about\\nany  document  it  specifically  says  has  been  anticipated  by  publication  in  India  or\\nelsewhere in any document other than those mentioned in subsection 1 The documents\\nmentioned  in subsection  1 where only complete  specifications  and if is a complete\\nspecification you are going to look at the claim. And this concept is called prior claiming.\\nIf it is not a complete specification say, it is a journal article or it is a paper published in a\\nscientific conference or it is an instruction manual of a new product. In all these cases,\\nyou would look at anticipation, but not you will not do the, you will there will there are\\nsimply no claims for you to look for. So, this is what we call as anticipation by prior\\npublication. So, this is a different category and when we look at the language in section\\n25  which  details  the  grounds  of  opposition  and  section  64which  gives  a  grounds\\nrevocation you will see that, anticipation comes in different categories. The anticipation\\ncould be by prior claiming, anticipation could be by prior publication, and anticipation\\ncould also be by prior use.\\nSo, we will look at those categories when we come to that section, but 1 talk about\\ncomplete specification anticipation by complete specification, both published before the\\ndate of filing of the applicant’s specification and after the date. 2 talks about every other\\ndocument, which is not covered in 1. The subsection 3 states that, where a complete\\nspecification is amended under the provisions of this act before the grant of a patent the\\namended  specification  shall  be  examined  and  investigated  in  a  like  manner  as  the\\noriginal specification. Now any amendment before the grant will be examined by the\\ncontroller.  It  is  just  that  while  an  application  is  pending,  the  applicant  carries  an\\namendment the amendment should also be examined in the same manner. A report under\\n13 is required even for an amendment.\\n 373  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 376}), Document(page_content='Subsection 4 states that the examination and investigations required under section 12 and\\nthis section there is, 13 shall be deemed shall not be deemed in any way to warrant the\\nvalidity of any patent and no liability shall be incurred by the central government or any\\nofficer thereof by reason of or in connection with any such examination or investigation\\nor any report or other proceeding consequence there on.\\nNow  this  is  an  immunity  provision  which  protects  the  central  government  and  the\\nofficers. It just says that, an examination done will not warrant the validity of a patent.\\nSo, even if the examiner makes a statement that the patent can be granted because it does\\nnot  it  satisfies  the  test  of novelty and  inventive  state  and  later  on if  the  patent  is\\nchallenged in a court of law or before the applied board and if it is invalidated, they\\ncannot be any action against the patent office or it is officers.\\nSo, it is to protect them it is it is an official protection that is required to say that, they\\ninvestigations  that  they would  do not warrant the validity of a  patent.  So, we can\\nunderstand the examination as a preliminary validity. You know, the examination actually\\ncomprises of a preliminary validity, they do a validity check, but it is a preliminary\\ncheck.\\nSo, if you  come  up with better evidence  or better prior art and if you  are able to\\nchallenge the patent the courts of law will definitely look into.

This provision actually protects\\nthe patent office that they cannot be any liability incurred on the central government on\\nany officer by the fact that they granted a patent which was valid and which was later\\nwhich could be challenged as invalid.\\n 374  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 377}), Document(page_content='Patent Law for Engineers and Scientists\\nProf. Feroz Ali\\nDepartment of Management\\nIndian Institute of Technology, Madras\\nLecture - 32\\nPatent Prosecution: Publication and Examination - II\\nProcedure in case of Anticipation\\n(Refer Slide Time: 00:16)\\nRule 28: Procedure in case of anticipation by prior publication. Rule 28 describes what\\nshould be the procedure that the controller should follow in cases of anticipation and we\\nsaw in section 18 the powers of a controller in cases of anticipation and we saw that\\nwhere there is a case of anticipation. The applicant can either show to the satisfaction of\\nthe controller that the claim is actually the priority of the claim of his application is\\nbefore the date of the prior art document that is sited against him or he can amend his\\ncomplete specification to get over the objection. These are the two things the applicant\\ncan do in some cases. We also saw in section 18 the controller can add a reference to an\\napplication which was published after the priority date, but which was filed before the\\npriority date of the applicant’s patent. Now in rule 28 the procedure is described. Rule\\n28(1) states that- if the controller is satisfied after investigation under section 13 that the\\ninventions so far as claimed in any complete specification has been published in any\\nspecification or other document refer to in sub section (1)(a) or sub section (2) of the said\\nsection, they were section 13. So, 13(1)(a) or 13(2) any of the documents mentioned in\\n 375  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 378}), Document(page_content='this which are largely we know that a document in the form of a complete specification\\nor  any  other  document.  The  controller  shall  communicate  the  gist  of  the  specific\\nobjections and the basis thereof to the applicant and the applicant shall be afforded an\\nopportunity to amend his specification.\\nSo, once the controller finds that there is a case of anticipation the controller shall\\ncommunicate the gist of the specific objections. Now we do not understand or the rule\\nhere is not clear as to how that communication can happen. It just says the controller\\nshall communicate the gist of the specific objections and the basis thereof. Why those\\nobjections  were raised?  Which means,  if there is  a prior art document  kind of the\\ndocument is prior filed patents specification the controller will have to give the number,\\nand if there is a particular claim then he should he would mention that claim so and so of\\nyour application is anticipated by claim so and so of this prior.\\nSo, that is what we understand as gist of specific objections and the basis thereof, so that\\nthe controller will have to communicate to the applicant.\\n(Refer Slide Time: 03:35)\\nSo, when the applicant receives this if rule 28(2) says if the applicant contest any of the\\nobjections communicated to him by the controller under sub rule (1) or if he re files his\\nspecification along with his observation as to whether or not the specification is to be\\namended, he shall be given an opportunity to be heard in the manner if he; so, request.\\nSo, we saw that the controller communicates the applicant can respond to the objections\\n 376  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 379}), Document(page_content='and he can also request for a hearing opportunity to be heard; yes, if he makes a request\\nfor hearing the controller will have to hearing.\\nSo, in this process it could come as an objection raised by a controller and wherever an\\nobjection is raised by the controller the applicant is afforded an opportunity to clarify the\\nobjection in addition the applicant can also request for a hearing and there are provisions\\nunder the patents act where a hearing can be requested and the manner in which hearing\\nshould be conducted.\\nProvided that such request shall be made on a date earlier than 10 days of the final date\\nof the period refer to a subsection one of section 21. Now section 21; we have not come\\nto that section yet deals with the timelines for putting a patent, in order section 21 is title\\ntime for putting application in order for grant section 21 fundamental premise is when\\nthe offers communicate an objection by way so far or by subsequent objections there is a\\ntime within which the applicant will have to respond the time line is given in section 21.\\nAnd now that we have an expedited  examination  some  of the timelines  have even\\nbecome shortened. So, there are timelines have become shortened in the case of an\\nexpedited  examination.  So,  section  21  talks  about  the  timelines  for  putting  the\\napplication in order for grant the time that is given to put the application in order. So, that\\nit can be granted which means the time given to the applicant to carry out the objections\\nraised by the controller to respond to the objections in a manner in which the controller\\nsatisfied to grant the patent.\\nSo, this timeline the proviso here tells us that before the request for hearing has to be\\nmade 10 days earlier to the final date of the period refer to an section 21(1) hearing when\\nyou make a request for a hearing the it takes when you make a request for a hearing the\\ncontroller will have to make an arrangement for the applicant to be present in his office,\\nso hearing take some time. So, that is why you find a 10 day period that is given before\\nthe expiry of the final date you have to make a request for hearing there are other\\nprovisions of the patents act where if you request for a hearing say in a or when a hearing\\nis communicated there is a similar notice period so that the parties and the controller can\\nprepare for a hearing.\\nSo, hearing is not something that is given without advance notice hearing should under\\nthe act always be proceeded by a notice period sub rule 2 further continuous provided\\n 377  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 380}), Document(page_content='further that is request for hearing may be allowed to be filed within such shorter period\\nas a controller may deem fit in the circumstances of the case or the controller may have a\\nshorter period for the applicant to request for a hearing and that is left to the discretion of\\nthe controller.\\nIn a normal case you can make a request 10 days before the final date of the period under\\nsection 21, but in some cases the controller can allow a shorter period. So, the controller\\nwhen he communicates the gist of the specific objections the controller can also say\\nrespond to me in 30 days time or respond to me in 2 weeks time. So, this provision\\nallows the controller to set a shorter period for instant if the controller feels that the\\nobjection can be adjust much quicker, he need not wait for the entire time period to end\\nor if the controller feels that there are other applications of similar nature pending and he\\nwants to take them all together he can ask response to be given at a shorter notice.\\nSo, there could be various administrative reason why a controller can insist on a shorter\\nperiod, but the power is given under sub rule 3 if the applicant request for a hearing\\nunder sub rule 2 within a period of one month from the date of communication of the gist\\nof  objections  or  the  controller  consider  to  desirable  to  do.  So,  whether  or  not  the\\napplicant has re filed his application he shall forthwith fix a date and time for hearing\\nhaving regard to the period remaining for putting the application in order or to the other\\ncircumstances of the case.\\nNow, if a request for hearing is made within 1 month. So, the gist of objections is\\ncommunicated  to  the  applicant  by  the  controller  the  applicant  receives  the  gist  of\\nobjections and within one month he requests for a hearing. So, there is a 1 month time\\nperiod for him to request for a hearing the request shall be made within the period\\nstipulated in an 21 there is a period stipulated within which the prosecution has to end 10\\ndays before that is the time line it is the last time period given for the applicant to make\\nthe request he cannot make if the time line is ending on January 31st of a particular\\nmonth he cannot make a request for hearing 2 or 3 days before that the rest be a clear 10\\ndays before which he can make a request.\\nNow, sub rule  3 tells  us that when the  gist of the objections  is  communicated  the\\napplicant  can  make  a  request  for  hearing  within  one  month  from  the  date  of\\ncommunication. Now if the applicant makes a request it as to be within 1 month of\\n 378  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 381}), Document(page_content='receiving the communication containing the gist of objections the controller shall fix a\\ndate regardless of whether the applicant has re filed his papers. Now, when an objection\\ncomes saying that there is a particular prior art one recues for the applicant is to amend\\nhis specification.\\nSo, that is what we call refilling his application, he has to re file his application, he has to\\nfile that amendment whether or not he has refilled it whether or not he has carried out the\\namendment the controller can go ahead and fix date and time of hearing. Now the date\\nand time of hearing will be fixed taking into consideration the remaining time for putting\\nthe application in order for a grant. Now I will give you a hypothetical situation.\\nAssume that when assigned for the first time the applicant has 1 year to reply now let us\\nsay 6 months to reply the applicant replies within a month. So, there is still 5 more\\nmonths time period left the controller further communicates and says that there is an\\nobjection on anticipation. Now this happens in the second month the applicant can make\\nan amendment and request for a hearing within the third month he is entitled to do that.\\nNow when he does that when he makes a request the controller will now have to said the\\nhearing keeping the final date in mind, he knows that there is a 6-month period beyond\\nwhich within which the changes have to be carried out.\\nSo, the controller will always fix the time period keeping this time in at what stage is the\\npatent application in and how much longer does the applicant have to put the application\\nin order for a grant we saw that in rule 24B examination of application we saw the\\ntimelines, we also saw in rule 24C what are the timelines in the case of an expedited\\nexamination now rule 24B and 24C actually expand on the timelines  mentioned  in\\nsection 21.\\nSection 21 tells you that if the controller gives you time to do something you have to do\\nsomething within that time. If you do not do it your application will be treated as\\nabandoned in this  a hearing when a specific  objection is raised on anticipation  the\\napplicant cant reply to them and also request for a hearing when the applicant request for\\na hearing it should not be at the end of the time that is allocated to it should be at least 10\\ndays before the end of the time allocated to him that is one thing.\\nSecondly when you receive your objection the hearing has to be requested within 1\\nmonth  of  receiving  the  objection.  So,  these  are  2  different  things  I  receive  the\\n 379  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 382}), Document(page_content='communication from the controller within 1 month I will have to request for a hearing,\\nbut that request should not be in the end of the time period allotted to me if there are only\\n10 days left. Then I should do it immediately upon receive I should not wait for a longer\\ntime, because the law says that there has to a 10-day period before which you can before\\nthe expiry of your allocated time to make this request.\\nNow, the date and the time will be fixed by the controller keeping this time line in mind.\\nSo, the timeline will largely depend on section 21 rule 24B and rule 24C this will decide\\nhow much time an applicant has to put the application in order for a grant 20.\\n(Refer Slide Time: 14:30)\\nNow, sub rule 4 the application shall be given 10 days notice of such hearing I already\\nmentioned that the normal there is a notice period for hearing and its 10 days in this case\\nor  such  shorter  notice  period  as  appears  to  the  controller  to  be  reasonable  in  the\\ncircumstances of the case and the applicant shall as soon as possible notify the controller\\nwhether he will be attending the hearing.\\nNow, once a request for hearing is made by the applicant the controller can give notice of\\nthe time and date of hearing. So, I as an applicant if I make a request I cannot make a\\nrequest and end up in the patent office, because I am only making a request for the\\nhearing I am not going to ask the controller to fix the date fixing the date and time we\\nsaw in the earlier sub rule is given it is a discretion of the controller, because the\\n 380  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 383}), Document(page_content='controller  has  his  own  administrative  duties  the  controller  now, and  he  has  many\\napplications on which he is which is prosecuting.\\nSo, fixing the date and time has to be done by the controller and that is communicated to\\nthe applicant when that is communicated the controller can either give a 10 days’ notice\\nperiod notice period is he sends a letter saying the hearing will be after 10 days or if the\\ncircumstances require it can be a shorter period. Now assume that everything is going to\\nhappen an objection is raised just 15 days before the allocated time the allocated time\\nends in 15 days controller sends an objection just 15 days before that now the 1-month\\nperiod will have no meaning. Now you have to move very quickly because you only\\nhave 15 days period and the applicant knows that he has only 15 days period and say he\\ncommunicates on the 5th day. Now the controller will not have time to give a 10 days’\\nnotice.\\nSo, in such cases he makes and give a shorter notice. So, that is the power is given in sub\\nrule 4 ideally the notice period for a hearing the letter communicating the date and venue\\nof the hearing will have a 10 day before the hearing ideally, but if the controller needs to\\ngive a shorter period he can do that sub rule 5 after hearing the applicant or without a\\nhearing if the applicant has not attended or has notify that he does not decided to be\\nheard the controller may specify or permit such amendment of the specification as he\\nthinks fit to be made and may refuse to grant the patent unless the amendment to the\\nspecified or permitted unless amendment. So, specified or permitted is made within the\\nperiod as may be fixed.\\nSo, after the hearing in the hearing the applicant will put forward the case that he has\\nsubmitted either trying to satisfy the controller that the prior art is different and does not\\naffect his priority or filing an amendment. So, once the applicant does that sub rule 5\\nsays that the controller may specify or permit such amendment as he thinks it controller\\nmay ask for another amendment or the controller may allow that amendment that is one\\nthing he can do or if the controller is not satisfied, he may refuse to grant the patent\\nunless the amendment.\\nSo, specification is made within such period as may be fixed now this language is taken\\nfrom the language of section 15. And we saw in section 15 the controller can require an\\namendment if the amendment is filed then the patent is granted if the amendment filed is\\n 381  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 384}), Document(page_content='not satisfactory or no amendment is filed then the controller can refuse to grant the\\npatent. So, this sub rule is though it comes in the context of anticipation the hearing\\nhappens under section 15 and the order that is passed also happens under section 15. So,\\nthis sub rule talks about the power of the controller to amend and the power of the\\ncontroller to refuse to grant and patent.\\nBoth the powers are contained in section 15(6) which was introduced recently states that\\nthe hearing may also be held through video conferencing or audio-visual communication\\ndevices provided that such hearing shall be deemed to have been taken place at the\\nappropriate office appropriate office is defined as the office where the application is filed\\nand the office that is prosecuting the application.\\n(Refer Slide Time: 19:34)\\nRule 4 appropriate office the appropriate office of the patent office shall one for all\\nproceedings under the act be the head office or the patent office or the branch office as\\nthe case may be within whose territorial limits  the applicant or the first mentioned\\napplicant in case of joint application normally resides or has his domicile or has a place\\nof business or the place from where the invention actually originated.\\nNow, if all these things are there appropriate office will be where the applicant resides or\\nhas his domicile or has a place of business or where the invention actually originated or\\nthe applicant for a patent or a party in the proceeding if he has no place or business or\\n 382  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 385}), Document(page_content='domicile in India the address for service in India given by such applicant or party is\\nsituated now.\\nSo, if the applicant does not have a place in India, he does not do business in India he\\ndoes not reside in India or he is not domiciled in India we know that foreigners can file\\napplications here then the appropriate office will be decided by the address for service in\\nIndia.

Rule 29(1) deals with a\\nprocedure that has to be followed when there is an anticipation by prior claiming in rule\\n 385  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 388}), Document(page_content='28, we saw that rule 28(1) there is an investigation and the controller is satisfied that the\\ninvestigation that there are certain  objections  are communicated  and the gist of the\\nspecific objections are communicated. And an opportunity is given to amend now the\\napplicant  can  contest  that  or  re-file  his  specification.  And  he  can  request  for  an\\nopportunity to be heard and he shall be given an opportunity to be heard and there are\\ntimelines for the hearing.\\nAfter the hearing the controller may either accept the amendments to the specification or\\nrefuse the amendment now this is broadly the procedure under rule 28 rule 29(1) states\\nthat when it is found that an invention. So, far as claimed in any invention of a complete\\nspecification which means I have said this is the short form when it is found that a claim\\nif claim did not any claim of any other specification falling within 13(1)(b) the applicant\\nshall be.\\nSo, informed and shall be afforded an opportunity to amend. So, here the procedure is\\nquite simple there we saw in 28 to understand 29 in detail you will always have to\\ncompare it with rule 28 in rule 28 we saw that what is communicated is the gist of the\\nobjections and the objection comes under section 13 the gist of the specific objection is\\ncommunicated here what is communicated is the fact that something is prior claimed\\nwhat is claimed in the applicants specification has been claimed in another specification\\nthat is all it is a case of prior claiming. So, the applicant shall. So, be informed and shall\\nbe afforded an opportunity to amend just 2 things here inform the applicant that it is there\\nin a prior claim and give him an opportunity to amend.\\n29(2) if the applicant’s specification is otherwise in order for grant and other wise in\\norder for grant you will always go back to section 43. Section 43 is the cross reference\\nfor rule 29(2), because whenever we see the word other order for grant an application is\\nmade ready for a grant or made in order for a grant or becomes ready for a grant under\\nsection 43. Section 43 is a provision which grants it and it has to satisfy all the objections\\nthat could be raised and only when it overcomes all the objections it is in order for a\\ngrant and an objection under section 13(1)(b) is outstanding the controller may postpone\\nthe grant of the patent and allow a period of 2 months for removing the objection.\\nSo, when there is an outstanding objection, we understand this as it is otherwise its ready\\nfor a grant, but in objection is outstanding a 13(1)(b) a objection is outstanding the\\n 386  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 389}), Document(page_content='controller  will postpone the grant and give a period of 2 months  for removing  the\\nobjection. So, you could have a question that under rule 29 or under section 13(1)(b) if\\nthere is an outstanding objection under section 13(1)(b) what is the time period that the\\ncontroller shall give for removing the objection.\\nSo, 1-month, 2-month, 3-month, 4-month, so, you could have a objective type question\\nbased on this because it is a very particular provision it is much different from rule 28;\\nrule 28 the controller does not give any time. Now the reason is under rule 28 it is an\\ninvestigation  of  anticipation  by prior  publication  and  prior  publication  will  involve\\nmapping the claim of the applicant’s specification to a published material it need not be a\\nclaim whereas, in 29 there is an existing claim existing claim is to be. So, in 29 we are\\ntalking about a claim to claim comparison.\\nSo, it is much more specific there is no need for anyone to read a document understand\\nthe scope of the document interpret the document here it is just claim to claim mapping,\\nbecause its claim to claim mapping the controller can be very specific in his requirement\\nwithin  2  months  overcome  the  objection,  I  am  postponing  the  grant  for  2  months\\novercome it by remove the objection. So, so the procedure is shorter and much more\\nspecific because it is a claim to claim mapping.\\nWhereas, in anticipation by publication it need not be a claim to claim mapping in most\\ncases it is going to be a claim mapped with another document another publication rule 30\\namendment of complete specification in case of anticipation.\\n 387  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 390}), Document(page_content='(Refer Slide Time: 31:52)\\n31 states that if the applicant. So, request at any time or if the controller is satisfied that\\nthe objection is not removed within the period refer to in 29(2) which we just saw a date\\nof hearing the applicant shall be fixed forthwith and the applicant shall be given at least\\n10 days notice of the date. So, fixed the applicant shall as soon as possible notify the\\ncontroller whether he will attend the hearing. Now you can draw a list of types of hearing\\nunder the patents act and you will be surprised to see under how many provisions you\\ncan have different hearings.\\nThe default hearing provision is under section 15 any objection a controller is incline to\\nrefuse an application he can call for a hearing and by based on that if he asks the\\napplicant to amend the specification or if he asks the applicant or if he rejects the\\napplication or if he grants the application, if he is going to write an order, I am granting\\napplication because of this reason they overcome it, I want the application to be amended\\nbased on this reason or I am rejecting the application based on this reason they will all be\\norders under section 15, because the power to refuse an application comes only under\\nsection 15 and we know that the controller shall not exercise his discretion without\\ngiving a hearing.\\nSo, in 15 hearing is compulsory or mandatory we can say that in under section 15 if the\\ncontroller has a section 15 proceeding hearing is mandatory because there is a provision\\nunder the patent’s rules. Rule 129 which states that the exercise of discretionary power\\n 388  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 391}), Document(page_content='by the controller shall be done only after affording a hearing to the party who would be\\naffected. So, rule 129 mandates the controller to have a hearing. So, under section 15 if\\nthe  controller  asks  the  applicant  to  amend  the  specification,  he  is  exercising  his\\ndiscretionary power or if he wants to refuse the application; again, he will be exercising\\nhis discretionary power he has a choice to do things in different ways that is where\\ndiscretion comes in.\\nSo, wherever he can exercise his discretion there he has to give a hearing now there are\\ncases where the controller cannot exercise discretion; there is no need for a hearing the\\napplicant files a request for examination there is no discretion required on the controller\\nhas to posted for examination he cannot now here the request for a hearing or I want to\\nknow why you want this to be examined that question does not arise. So, there is no\\ndiscretionary power when for many things under the patents act it is a procedure there is\\na rule the controller has to do the next thing, but wherever he can exercise discretion; we\\nunderstand discretion as a choice either to do one thing or another thing under 15 we can\\ngrant a patent ask for amendment refuse the patent application. So, you can do 3 things.\\nSo, that is why discretion comes in. So, where he exercises his discretion under rule 129,\\nwe know that he has to give the applicant or a party a hearing this is to satisfy the\\nprinciples of natural justice where it is a principle in law and the Indian legal system\\nrecognizes that principle; that if you have to take a decision if a government authority\\nhas to take a decision in a matter pertaining to a third party an applicant who has gone\\nbefore the government authority he has to hear the other side without whatever decision\\nhe passes without hearing the other side without hearing the party concern, if he passes a\\ndecision. Then that is what we call there is a violation of the principle of natural justice\\nthe that the principle of natural justice tells us that you should not pass any order without\\nhearing the party who will be affected that is a principle in law which says that you\\nshould not pass any order without hearing the give him an opportunity you have to call\\nthat person give him an opportunity hear his case and then pass the order.\\nSo, this provision 129 tells us that there has to be a hearing. So, we were on the point that\\nif you enlist the hearings under the act and the rules you will be surprised to find that\\nthere are there could be a hearing under section 15, they could be a hearing under section\\n14 you could have hearings under section 25(1) hearings are mandatory under section\\n25(2) we saw in rule 30 they could be a hearing.

The easiest example for\\nanti dating is when a divisional is filed the divisional gets the date priority date of the\\nparent, it is a clear-cut case of divisional getting the date of the parent this is an anti\\ndating.

So,\\nthe complaint does not get the priority of the provisional because of the provisional is\\nwithdrawn in that case the earlier date is given up and the invention gets the date of\\ncomplete. So, it gets post dated.\\n 403  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 406}), Document(page_content='The idea of filing a provisional was to preserved priority, but now if you withdrawn it\\nthen there is no point in claiming that priority because you withdrawn the application it is\\nnot there in the system. So, see these are the two cases where the date of priority can\\neither be anti dated or it can be post dated. Anti dated we understand it as divisional\\napplication post dated one instance of post dating is where a provisional is filed and the\\npriority is given up, it is withdrawn. The provision is withdrawn, so the only priority will\\nbe the priority from the date of filing the complaint. Now there are some powers the\\ncontroller has with respect to dating.\\nNow 17(1) states that subject to provision of section 9 and section 9 talks about post\\ndating section 9 specifically refers to the post dating at any time after filing of an\\napplication and before the grant of the patent under this act the controller may at the\\nrequest of the applicant made in the prescribed manner direct the application direct that\\nthe application shall be post dated to such dated as may be specified in the request and\\nproceed with the application accordingly.\\nSo, if a request is made by the applicant saying that I do not want my earlier priority I\\nwant  the  priority from later  part  it  is  called  post  dating.  It is  done voluntarily for\\nwhatever is reason the discloser may not have been perfect for whatever reason or it is\\ndifficult for the applicant to show fare bases, it is difficult for the applicant to show\\nbecause it the discloser was not good for whatever reason or they do not want any\\ndiscloser they made in the provisional to be later be published whatever be the reason the\\napplicant and there is a risk in post dating, the risk is from that time till it is post dated if\\nthere is going to be any intervening prior art that can affect the novelty. That is a risk, it\\nthere is always a risk in post dating because you are sifting the point of priority from an\\nearlier date to a later date. So, there is an always a risk accompanied by that and risk may\\nbe there it may not be there the risk could be in the way of an inter meaning prior art.\\nSo, under 9 if an applicant makes a request in the prescribed manner it shall be post\\ndated and the date once it is post dated for all practical purposes that date of priority will\\nbe from that date. Date of priority will be that date, date of filing the application if it is\\ndate of filing the application we already mentioned if you file for the first time if you file\\na complete then the date of filing the application as the priority, then we do not use the\\nword priority we just say date of filing because that is the time at which it is start. So, it\\nis an easier terminology data filing there was nothing filed before, so we say data filing.\\n 404  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 407}), Document(page_content='But if you file a provisional and then follow it up with the complete, we do not use the\\nword data filing because the data filing may mean two things then we use the word\\npriority date. So, the priority language comes in if you saw the priority rules and section\\n11, priority language comes in when there is an earlier discloser and later claim. So, if\\nthe claim and the discloser are in one go, we refer to the data of filing.\\nAnd in international applications you cannot file an international based on provisional\\nwe saw that it is a requirement that you file the complete. So, in all that do you will find\\nthe language date of filing, date of filing is the date of patent date of filing, so date of\\nfiling  because this  it comes  in one go. 17(1) provided that no application  shall be\\npostdated under the subsection to a date later than 6 months from the date on which it\\nactually made or would, but for the provisions of the subsection we deem to have been\\nmade.\\nNow the post dating cannot happen for more than 6 months. So, if you plan to post dated\\nthere is a time line. If you file an earlier application and if you want to post dated the\\npost dating has to happen in the context of section 9. So, you remember post dating can\\nbe in the contest of section 9; it could also be on section 9. In the context of section 9\\nsection 9(4) talks about postdating.\\nWhere a complete specification has been filed in pursuance of an application for a patent\\naccompanied by a provisional specification that is a provisional followed by a complete\\nor a specification treated by virtue of direction under a subsection under 3 that is the\\ncomplete, we had already dealt with that. As a provisional the controller may if the\\napplicant, so request post dating is always another requesting of the control under section\\n9 the post dating is done at the request of the applicant at any time. So, request at any\\ntime before a grant of a patent cancel the provisional and posted the application to the\\ndata filling of the complaint.\\nNow this canceling or this request for postdating has to happen within 6 months of filing.\\nSo, 17 we get that that the post dating under the subsection to a date later than 6 months\\nfrom the date shall not be allowed. So, the post dating can only happen within 6 months,\\nwe need not look at what is a logic of 6-month period we can just say that the post dating\\nwould we can assume that if the post dating is allowed for a period for many years. one it\\ncannot be allowed be on 12 months because the provisional has to be followed by a\\n 405  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 408}), Document(page_content='complete within 12 months.

The application specification or\\nother document shall be the controller. So, direct we deem to have been made on the date\\non which  the requirement  is  complied  with  or way the application  specification  or\\ndocument is return to the applicant on the rate on which it is re filed after complying with\\nthe requirement. Now this is not in the context of Provisionals, rather this is after a\\ncomplete specification is filed because section 15 comes into play only after complete\\nspecification as filed.\\nNow in section 15 as you know section 15 comes into play when the controller is\\nunhappy with an application, he finds that there are reasons to reject and he asks the\\napplicant to make certain amendments. The applicant makes certain amendment and\\nrefiles it, and assumes that the invention is disclosed earlier, but based on the objections\\nand another part of the invention is for the first time included based on the controller’s\\nobjections, so that part what was included based on the controller’s objections  that\\ndiscloser happens for the first time.\\nYou can now claim an earlier priority on that. So, that discloser when you put in to the\\npatent office it will get the priority date from their own. So, in a sense there is a post date\\nis here because whenever files were an amendment based on an objection from the\\ncontroller and you introduced a new matter, when you introduced a new matter then your\\npriority is going to change from there for instance there  are 10 claims  filed in an\\napplication. The controller rises certain objections and all the claims have now to be the\\ncontroller is no willing to allow even one claimant. So, based on the objections in a\\nsection 15 proceeding the applicant drafts a new set of claims completely different from\\nthe ten which he had filed and he also makes appropriate amendments in the discloser.\\n 406  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 409}), Document(page_content='Now, all these new claims will take a date different from the claims that were filed in the\\nfirst instance because these claims were not there. So, the dating of this claim will be\\ndifferent from the date of the claims that were initially filed because of all those claims\\nwere rejected by the controller. So, the claims that were file later will take the date on\\nwhich it was filed that is what the language says deem to have been filed on the date on\\nwhich is the requirement is complied with.\\nThe controller feels that 10 claims cannot be granted the 10 claims have to be amended\\nsay they were amended.

So, any complaints that happens, so ideally 17(2) tells us that whatever\\nyou do in the patent office it has to be perfect for you to get the priority. If it is not in\\norder and if you have to make amendments then things can get post dated. So, post\\ndating of documents is there and post dating of priority date is there, in 17(1) we saw the\\npriority being post dated based on a provisional.\\nHere we 17(2) is on post dating it includes specification document drawing post dating\\ndocuments.\\n 407  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 410}), Document(page_content='(Refer Slide Time: 13:02)\\nSection 18 powers of a controller in case cases of anticipation we saw that under section\\n12 and 13 the controller can direct the applications to be examine by an examiner and\\nunder section 12 it is stated that the examiner shall make a report on various things and\\none of the that thing that the examiner will make a report will include the results of\\ninvestigations made under section 13 and we saw in section 13 the examiner can make a\\nreport on anticipation by previous publication or by priority and we saw the instance in\\nwhich the report can cover cases of anticipation and when we talk about anticipation we\\nare only talking about the first requirement in patentability which is novelty. So, when\\nwe say something is anticipated then we mean that it lacks novelty, novelty is not that the\\nfact that the invention has to be new is not satisfied.\\nSo, in section 13 the examiner can look at any previous patent, any patent that is granted\\nearlier and which would mean any claim that is granted earlier. So, prior claiming is\\ncovered in section 13, section 13 also covers prior publications. So, in section 13 there\\nare two kinds of document you can look at one is an earlier filed patent application or an\\nearlier file specification which will have a claim. So, when there is a claim that over laps\\nwith the present claim we call it prior claiming, the claim was already claimed in other\\napplication.

So, so when that happens, we call it prior publication. So, 13 covers both these\\ninstances it includes prior claiming and prior publication. Publication we understand as a\\nnon-patent document, in prior art search we do a non-patent search, non-patent literature,\\nwhereas patent literature or patent search is what covers prior claiming.\\n18(1) states that where it appears to the controller that the invention.

If it is a same day also the controller will allow or it is the before the\\ndate of that prior art document because anything that is published after my application\\ncannot be used as a priority document to challenge my application it cannot be used as a\\nprior  art  document.  The  second  thing  he  amends  his  complete  specification  to  the\\nsatisfaction of the controller.\\nNow, (a) and (b) largely give the option that are opened to an applicant the applicants\\nfirst option is always to convince the controller only if then controller is not convinced\\nyou have to amend the application, no applicant would want to amended at the first\\ninstance, he would try to convince a controller to say that how does that convincing\\ncomes because here it says shows to the satisfaction of the controller now this involves\\nclaim interpretation.\\nOne the applicant can say that the scope of the document which you have sighted as prior\\nart it has to be interpreted this way if it is interpreted this way my invention will not fall\\nwithin this scope of way one way to do that. Second if you have a priority document\\nearlier to the date of prior art then you can say that say for instance you are exhibited\\nyour invention in an exhibition in a technical exhibition there are rules.\\nThere are provisions in patent act which allows you even after public display file an\\napplication within 1 year. But that information of your public display and the fact that\\nafter public display you file an application within one year is not there to the controller\\nthe controller just merely sights a prior art. But if you are able to show that before that\\nyou had actually disclosed in a public display or you had disclose something what we\\ncalled  transactions  of  learned  society  there  are  various  protected  categories  of\\nanticipation then you are able to convince the controller that that discloser was actually a\\nprotected discloser and because it is was a protected discloser you are entitled to claim\\npriority from that day onwards because you made a discloser which was a protected\\ndiscloser and you are able to follow it up with an application.\\n 410  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 413}), Document(page_content='So, all or you made an application aboard, based on a priority document filed aboard and\\nyou are claiming your priority from there in all these cases if you can show to the\\ncontroller to the satisfaction that the application that is filed is actually not hit by the\\nprior art either by a inter pertaining the claim and saying that this what is claimed is\\ndifferent from what I am claim or by showing that you have a valid reason for being\\nbefore the date of prior art. So, either way either by interpretation or by showing that\\nyour  specification  is  not  later  than  the  date  on  which  the  relevant  document  was\\npublished.\\nSo, under 18(1)(a) the applicants hand over will be to show that the priority date of the\\napplication is earlier than the prior art. Now assume that the applicant is not able to\\ndemonstrate there is a prior art much ahead in time and the applicant is not able to show\\nthat  his  priority, that  is  he did not know about it  if he found that application  was\\nanticipated by an earlier prior art much ahead in time then the option open to him is he\\ncan amend his specification to tear clear of the prior if the technology covering the patent\\nallows him to make an amendment and if the prior art also allows him to do that then he\\nmay amend his specification to the satisfaction of the controller that many a times people\\njust narrow down the scope of the invention in order to get a grant.\\nThere may be difficulties in enforcing that patent, but never the less the patent officers\\nconcern is there was a prior art we cannot grant you if you narrow down the scope of\\nyour invention, we may be able to granted and they may get a patent granted just a for\\nthat narrow claim. So, that is a second response.\\nIf you are not able to demonstrate to the controller that your priority date is before date\\nof the prior art the next option is to amend your specification. So, a and b under 18(1)\\ntells you the two responses to anticipation. The two responses to anticipation are one to\\nshow to the controller to satisfy the to satisfy the controller that the priority date is not\\nlater than the date on which the relevant document was published if that is not possible\\nthen you try to amend the specification to the satisfaction of the controller.

So, if there is an\\napplication made before the priority date and the application anticipates  the present\\napplication, then the controller has an option of directing a reference to be made to the\\nother specification this is called a reference and the reference only operates where there\\nis  a  pending  application  because  in  13(1)(b)  we  know  that  it  is  a  case  where  the\\nanticipating claim is in a complete specification that was published on or after the date of\\nfiling the complete specification applicant specification being as specification filed in\\npursuance of an application for a patent made in India and dated before or claiming the\\npriority earlier than that day.

The day on which I filed a\\nsoon after I filed it gets published, but it was pending all the while, but its reference was\\nto an earlier date, the priority was to an earlier date that mien.\\nSo, there is no way as an applicant could have checked or could have known about that\\nprior art because it got published the day I filed or soon after I filed in such cases the\\ncontroller may allow for reference because this is not the fault of the applicant, he did not\\nknow about this. So, the idea of a reference is that to give notice to the public that the\\nearlier application which the applicant did not know about any file covers or anticipates\\nit is a reference, but the reference can be damaging because then the earlier person can\\ncome and sue for infringement and say that you have filed a similar invention as mine so\\nany other issues can come.\\nBut an applicant can again get over that reference if he shows again the conditions shows\\nto the satisfaction of the controller that the priority date is earlier or he amends to the\\nsatisfaction of the controller the same two options are there, but here the only differences\\nthe day on which the applicant file the application he did not know about the earlier prior\\nart.

So, there is a power for the controller to insert\\na reference and it comes under section 13(1)(b) and the power is confine to cases where\\nan application got published on day in which I filed my application or soon afterwards.\\nSo, it only covers situations  where the applicant could not have seen that prior art\\nbecause the day on which he filed it got published or after he filed it got published.

The\\npatent office is not the authority to determine infringement, because once a patent is\\ngranted if there is infringement the patentee will file an infringement suit under section\\n104 claiming reliefs under 108.\\nSo, infringement is determined by the code, but the potential infringement mentioned\\nhere is with regard to the application that is spending before the controller. The controller\\nfeels that if this application is granted it will infringe another patent which is already\\nthere.

If in consequence of an investigation made under\\nsection 13 it appears to the controller that the appellants invention cannot be performed\\nwith  or  without  substantial  risk  of  infringement  to  a  claim  of  another  patent  the\\napplicants also be informed and the procedure provided in rule 29 shall so far as may be\\nnecessary be applicable.  So, this is quite straight forward. Just what we saw under\\nsection 29 the applicants shall be informed and the procedure in 29 will follow.\\nSo, it is quite straight forward that applicants shall be informed and the procedure in rule\\n29 shall be applicable.\\n 425  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 428}), Document(page_content='(Refer Slide Time: 17:43)\\nNow, how is  that form of reference to be made?  Reference to another patent  now\\nreference  to  another  specification  we  saw  that  will  be  done  by  referring  to  the\\nspecification number by which we mean that it could be an application number. So, rule\\n31 applies where the cross reference is to a pending application. Rule 33 applies when\\nthe cross reference is to a granted patent. So, if you face the question what does the\\ndifference between rule 31 and rule 33, we could have multiple answers the correct\\nanswer will be the choice will be ruled 31 deals with a cross reference to a pending\\napplication or an application, whereas rule 33 deals across a reference to a granted\\npatent.\\nSo, let us look at the rule 33 where a controller directs that a reference to another person\\nshall be in inserted in the applicant’s complete specification under 19(1), the reference\\nshall be inserted after the claims in the following form. Again, the place of insertion of a\\nreference is after the claims. So, that is a point to note that all references are made after\\ninserted after the claims which is same, we saw in 31 it is after the claims and in 33 is\\nalso it is after the claim the only difference is the references to a patent number in 33\\nwhereas, in 31 it is reference to an application number.

In all these\\ncases there has to be a substitution of the name of the applicant.

We are not talking about a patentee substitution, we are talking about an\\napplicant whose name is there in the application, how do we substitute a new applicants\\nname because for certain reasons the applicants have changed the person who was the\\napplicant is no longer the applicant and somebody else has come in his or her place the\\ncontroller has certain powers.\\nNow, let us look at that; 21 if the controller is satisfied on a claim made in the prescribed\\nmanner at any time before a patent has been granted. So, 20 point to be noted, section 20\\nthe powers of the controller under section 20 are before the grant of the patent. So, how\\ndo you change the name of a patentee? Section 20 does not apply because the patentee\\nwe call him a patentee when the patent is granted, we do not call him an applicant. We\\nrefer to the person as an applicant up until the time of the grant after the grant is called a\\npatentee or the patent holder. \\nSo, to substitute the name of a patentee this is not the provision. So, you need to bear that\\nin mind because this provision applies before the patent has been granted, that by virtue\\nof an assignment or agreement in writing. Now these are the things that you need to note\\nbefore the patent has been granted by virtue of any assignment or agreement in writing\\nmade by the applicant or one of the applicants of the patent or by operation of law.\\nThere are three things there could be an assignment, assignment is where you give your\\nright to another person, there could be an agreement, the agreement can be a takeover\\nagreement if it’s a company, it can be a share purchase agreement, if it is a company I\\npurchase the majority shares and I become the older or 100 percent shares, it could be\\nany agreement which is critical for this transaction or by operation of law. By operation\\nof law say the companies acquired by another company operation of law, or the company\\nbecomes bankrupt the company does not have money and all the assets of the company\\nare sold the patents alone are purchased by another party. So, that is operation of law.\\nThe patents  are purchased by when the company gets into bankruptcy proceedings,\\npatents being the asset of the company are purchased separately. So, that is something we\\ncalled operation of law. The claimant would if the patent may to be granted be entitled\\nthere to or to the interest of the applicant there in or an undivided share. Now the\\nclaimant is the person who wants to come in as the new applicant. So, claimant would be\\nif the patent is granted this is in the future. The patent is granted would be entitled there\\n 428  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 431}), Document(page_content='too, he will be entitled to becoming the applicant or to the interest of the applicant or\\nundivided  share  of  the  patent,  or of  that  interest  the  controller  may  subject  to  the\\nprovisions of the section direct the application to proceed in. So, the controller will\\ndirect, the application to proceed in the name of the claimant  or the names  of the\\nclaimant and the applicant or the other joint applicants accordingly as the case may\\nrequire.  There  are  three  instances  where  we  understand  in  the  section,  we  try  to\\nunderstand who the claimant is there is a claimant here, claimant is not the present\\napplicant.\\nClaimant we understand as a person, who has received something from the applicant\\nwhich  entitles  him  to  become  an  applicant.  So,  the  claimant  is  used  as  the  future\\napplicant or the new applicant let us call the new. Now this provision also contains\\ninstances where only an interest is given, the entire invention is not sold the entire\\ninvention is not given. So, there are three applicants they all together want to bring in the\\nfourth applicant, do you understand there are already three people because there can be\\nyou can make joint applications, there are only the three applicants say there are three\\nscientists had filed the patent in their own name. A fourth person was also help them, but\\nhis name did not come in the application.\\nNow, if they make an agreement with the fourth person to say that we recognize you are\\nright, you had made a contribution and they say that we will include you as a inventor or\\nbased on that agreement it is an agreement in writing, the fourth person can who can be\\nregarded as a claimant will not get the entire invention you will only get in undivided\\nshare that is one fourth of the invention, if that is the arrangement. So, this provision\\napplies for instances where a person gets the full patent full interest in it, and also cases\\nin which he may be a joint applicant. So, that is why it says a claimant who by three\\nthings, by agreement, by assignment, or by operation of law. Operation of law I said\\nthere is a bankruptcy proceeding something a legal  proceeding based on which the\\nclaimant came to acquire an interest.\\nSo, there is a claimant or claimants it could be one or more people, and the claimant by\\nvirtue of three things an agreement assignment or operation of law was entitled to the\\napplication itself, he came he was entitled to the application itself or to an interest or to\\nan undivided share. So, three things he was entitled to the patent, the application or to an\\ninterest  or two an undivided share of the patent  or that interest.  In such cases the\\n 429  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 432}), Document(page_content='controller shall direct the application to proceed in the name of the claimants, claimant or\\nclaimant or in case there are existing applicants who also continue with in then in their\\nnames jointly.\\nSo, I hope you understand this scheme, there is the claimant comes gets an interest in the\\napplication based on three things there is an agreement between the existing applicants or\\nthere is an assignment or by operation of law he gets an interest and what kind of interest\\nis that he has an he is entitled to the application or to an interest in which is not the full\\nright, but a part of it or he is entitled to in undivided share or an interest in that undivided\\nshare.\\nSo, when he is entitled to the invention itself or to a share in the invention, then the\\ncontroller can shall proceed as if the claimant has become an applicant. The controller\\nshall proceed with the claimant now shown as the applicant. So, the word claimant is\\nused here so that we do not get confused with the old applicant and the new applicant. 22\\nno such direction as a force it shall be given by virtue of an assignment or agreement any\\nassignment or agreement, made by two or more joint applicants for a patent except with\\nthe consent of other joint applicants. Now what did we see in 21?\\nIn 21 we saw a claimant making a claim that he should be treated as an applicant we saw\\nthat in 21. 22 states if there are joint applicants then the consent of all the applicant is\\nrequired before including somebody as a claimant. If the controller needs to give a\\ndirection this provision requires the claimant to make an application to the controller\\nunder form 6, and the controller will have to give a direction. So, the direction what is\\nbeing sort under this provision. 22 says that the controller will not give the direction till\\nthe consent of all the joint applicant are received let me give an example. there are 3\\napplicants to a particular application.\\nNow, a, b and c; a and b have an agreement with d, and they want to bring d into the list\\nof applicants. So, d becomes the claimant, these agreements is only with a and b, but not\\nwith c, but c is an existing applicant there are three applicants a, b and c, a and b have an\\nagreement with d, based on that agreement they want to bring d as a claimant he become\\nthey want to bring them as a new applicant. As per 22 the controller will not do it, he will\\nnot receive a direction till they get the consent of c. So, provision is very simple in case\\nyou  need to bring if you are a joint applicant with others you cannot bring a new\\n 430  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 433}), Document(page_content='applicant without everyone consenting. So, that is what it says except with the consent of\\nother joint applicants.\\nSo, all the joint applicants a, b and c will have to consent, if all of them do not consent\\nthe controller will not pass a direction it is just to protect the interest of the existing\\napplicants. 23 no such direction as aforesaid shall be given by virtue of any assignment\\nor agreement, for the assignment of a benefit of an invention. So, this is with regard to\\nassignment of a benefit of an invention unless a the invention is identified there in by\\nreference to a number identified by reference to the number of the application, there is\\nproduced to the controller and acknowledgement by the person by whom the assignment\\nor agreement was made acknowledgement by the person, who made the assignment or\\nagreement that the assignment or agreement release to an invention in respect of which\\nthe application is made, that it relates to the invention or c the right of a claimant in\\nrespect of the invention have been finally, established by decision of a court this is where\\nby operation of law. You saw that operation of the law the rights of a claimant have been\\nestablished by a decision of the court or d the controller gives direction for enabling the\\napplication to proceed for regulating the manner in which it should be proceeded under\\nsubsection 5.\\nController gives direction under sub section 5. We will see what sub section 5 is, but in\\n23 we say the it puts the requirements for the controller to pass a direction, before\\npassing a direction saying that somebody is the claimant, there are certain requirements.\\nThe first requirement  no such direction as aforesaid shall be given by virtue of an\\nassignment  on  agreement  for  the  assignment  of  a  benefit.  So,  whether  there  is  an\\nassignment of a benefit in an invention, as assignment is where you want to give a part of\\nthe right to another person. Then the controller will insist that the invention is referenced\\nby the application number, because we are still in the application stage.\\nSo, the assignment that agreement should referred to the application number. So, if the\\nparties  come  with  an  agreement  without  the  application  number, mentioned  in  the\\nagreement the controller will not act by it. So, there can be a question what are the\\nrequirements of the document that has to be filed along with form 6. You can give\\nmultiple choices it should contain the patent number, it should contain the application\\nnumber, it should have a cross reference to all the names of the party, you can come up\\nwith many answers; the correct answer will be it should have a cross reference to the\\n 431  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 434}), Document(page_content='application number. So, you could create questions on that, but understand this is yet\\nanother case of cross reference.\\nSo, you could make a chart on all the cross references under the patents act. So, where\\never you can do a control on the act and find all the references, and you can make a chart\\nwith the provisions; type of reference, reference to which part or reference to what the\\nsection of the relevant rule, and the gist of it. So, that it becomes easier to memorize. So,\\nthis pertains to the first requirement is that there has to be a reference to the application\\nnumber when or there is an acknowledgement by the person who made the assignment\\nthat the assignment release to the invention in respect of its application has made the\\nperson who makes the assignment, should say that this assignment is pertaining to this\\napplication is not mention the number is not mentioned, but he says this is with regard to\\nan application, it is clearly identified by the person who makes the acknowledgement, it\\nclearly identified that they are talking about a particular invention.\\nSo, the person who makes the assignment acknowledges the invention. So, there is no\\ndoubt. So, what is the objective here? In the first case a person who reach the agreement\\nshould know what the invention is. In the second case we say that the person who makes\\nthe assignment should acknowledge, that this is the invention that is being transferred or\\nthat is being that is for which there are seeking a direction or there is a decision of a\\ncourt. Say there was dispute with regard to inventors  or dispute with regard to an\\nagreement  joint  developed  agreement.  Two  institutes  come  up  with  an  agreement\\nmemorandum of understanding and later on they have an agreement to develop and\\ninvention two institutes. So, researchers from both the institutes do work and file an\\napplication. A third institute now comes and says I was also involved in the project, I\\nshould also be shown as an applicant. Institute the first two institutes say that no you are\\nnot involved and that becomes a dispute.\\nSo, the third institute approaches the court of law, with lot of documents to show that it\\nwas also involved and assume that the third researcher or institution is successful in\\ngetting an order from the court of law, saying that yes you made a contribution to the\\ninvention with lab notes and evidences of their they are finally, able to prove that. Now\\nbased on that court order you can make a direction. So, the court order will very clearly\\nsay what is the facts and circumstances of the case, what invention they are pertaining to\\nit may also say that the other two people have filed an application, this is the application\\n 432  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 435}), Document(page_content='number its pending before just patent of all the details will be there.

Now that is the concept in patent law if a\\npatent is wrongfully obtained then they can be an opposition on that ground now the\\nground has to be proved , now the person who files the opposition should either say it was\\nwrongfully obtained from me or wrongfully obtained from a person through whom the\\nopponent is claiming.\\nSo, this proceeding is unique because this ground of opposition is unique, because they\\ncould be some action that follows out of this section because in a case of a the patent act\\nrefers to this as a case of obtaining , if the obtaining happens after the grant of a patent\\n 460  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 463}), Document(page_content='then there can be a further proceeding or there can be certain actions that the controller\\ncan take under section 26.\\nNow, section 26 covers section 25 ( 2) aA, but we are currently discussing only section 25\\n1 aA., Iif a person wrongfully obtains a patent under section 26, the controller can take\\nsome measures to correct it, but in the pre grant of stage if the person has not wrongfully\\nobtained the patent he has not yet  wrong wrongfully obtained the patent, what has\\nhappened is that he has wrongfully obtained the invention, but that application has not\\nmaterialized into a patent. So, i t’st is a ; you should understand all the interventions at the\\npre grant stage as interventions before the grant of a patent. So, because a n patent has not\\nbeen granted the remedy under 26 is not open for the pre grant opponent whereas, the\\nremedy under 26 is open to a post grant opponent because a patent has already been\\ngranted.\\nSo, this you should understand under the scheme of the act , all the things that you do in a\\npre grant opposition is prior to the grant . Pprior to the grant means there is no right that\\nhas been granted to the patentee, whereas all the ground you raise the same grounds you\\nraise after the grant the patentee now already has a right his name is entered in the\\nregister of patent as the patentee.\\nSo, it is much difficult for you or for an opponent to challenge a right that is been granted\\nbecause that will involve different procedures , the evidence that he will have to introduce\\nwe  will be different though the grounds have the same words , the procedure you will\\nunderstand the involvement of an opposition board , elaborate hearings , all these things\\npoint towards a much more rigorous procedure and the fact that 26. Section 26 is not\\napplicable to section 25 ( 1 aA) is further proof that the rigor of a pre grant opposition is\\ndifferent from the rigor of a post grant opposition.\\nSo, as we go by we will understand p rost grant opposition to be a different procedure it is\\nmuch more detail than the pre grant, but the grounds continue to be the same. So, in case\\na person alleges that the applicant wrongfully obtains the invention like they all worked\\non a project. And one person the applicant went and filed a patent alone without taking\\ntheir interest into account or the applicant was working in a firm which had an NDA and\\na confidentiality agreement , and they were working on an invention he left the firm\\nresigned from the firm and filed the a patent. So, they could be n number of instances\\n 461  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 464}), Document(page_content='where  a  person  can  make  a  charge  that  the  invention  was  a  wrongfully  obtained\\nwrongfully obtained in a sense means that a person who filed the application was not the\\nperson who was entitled to be the applicant.\\nSo, wrongfully obtained the invention can have different , I mean it can be there could be\\nan allegation that he is not the true and first inventor and he is neither and assignee nor a\\nlegal representative , there can be an allegation that the idea or the invention was stolen , it\\nwas stolen , the idea was stolen while he was working on a project and he filed an\\napplication though he did not have a right to do it. So, to ascertain whether an invention\\nwas wrongfully obtained the controller .\\nWe  will  have  to  get  into  the  details  of  employment  to  see  whether  there  are  non\\ndisclosure agreements between the parties to see what was the relation between the\\nparties , and to understand the scheme of things in which the dispute evolved. As I\\nmentioned , they could have been working as a team , thean one person came out of the\\nteam and filed an application , it could be an application filed by an x employee , or an x\\npartner , there are n number of circumstances that would come in.\\nBut the ground of wrongful obtainment or wrongfully obtained that the invention was\\nwrongfully obtained pertains to disputes with regard to ownership of the application .\\nDdisputes with regard to who can make an application if the applicant did not have the\\nright to make it then we say that it was wrongfully obtained. So, these are not a disputes\\nor this is not a ground , wrongful obtained is not a ground where we attack the substantive\\nmerit of the patent . Iin an anticipation , we attack the substantial merit of the patent , in\\ninventive  lack of inventive step we attack the substantial merit of the patent . Tthis is\\nactually on the conduct of a applicant , how the applicant behaved. So, in Indian law , just\\nas in the US law , you can attack the validity of a patent based on the conduct of the\\napplicant of or the patentee , conduct of the patentee can be a ground in US for attacking\\nthe validity of a patent.\\nSo, this ground is pinned to the conduct of an applicant , it has nothing to do with the\\nsubstantial merit of the invention itself, because you will be not even produce any prior\\nart, if you  arer raising this ground .

So,\\n 462  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 465}), Document(page_content='this is we look at this as a ownership dispute , this is not a dispute with regard to\\nsubstantive merit of the patent . \\n25  (1 b)B,  that  the  invention  so  far  has  claimed  in  any  claim  of  the  complete\\nspecification has been published before the priority date of the claim  one  (i) in any\\nspecification filed in pursuance of an application of a patent made in India on or after the\\nfirst day of January 1912 or in India or elsewhere in any document provided the ground\\nspecified in to (ii) shall not be available may where such publication does not constitute\\nanticipation under section 29 (3) (2); 29 (3) (2) is an exception to anticipation  in. In fact,\\n29 and all the sections near it , or deal with exceptions to anticipation . Iinstances where\\nsomething we will not be from 29 to 34 you have instances where certain x acts will not\\namount to anticipation.\\nSo, this cross reference in sub clause  B is 2 29 29(2)(b)  says that in instances where\\ncertain  x  acts  do not constitute anticipation that has to be factor ed too2 and here the\\nspecific reference is to 29 ( 3) (2); 29 (3) (2) is the cross reference to this provision. Now\\nwe had already seen section 13 this language is very similar to section 13.\\nIn section 13 , the examiner has to make a report on anticipation , what is called the search\\nfor  anticipation  by  previous  publication  and  in  there  you  had  2  categories , one  is\\nanticipation by any specification filed in pursuance of the application for patent made in\\nIndia on or after 1 - 1- 1912. And we had mentioned as this is to show this is to include all\\nthe applications that were filed in the Indian patent office , we had also mentioned that the\\nsequence of patents that are numbered currently. In rule 37 , we had mentioned that we\\nare still following the numbering sequence that was given under the 1911 act , the Indian\\npatents and designs act 1911 came into effect on first January 1912.\\nSo, wherever you see this phrase , first day of January 1912 , it refers to the coming into\\nforce of the Indian patents and designs act 1911 , the act is 1911 it came into force on first\\nJanuary 1912. So, all the reference simply means that since the Indian patent office was\\nestablished. So, any specification filed in persons pursuance of an application for a patent\\nmade in India on or after the first of January 1912 means any patent application made in\\nIndia . Bbecause the nineteen seventy act repealed the 1911 act . Iin section 162, we had\\nseen that the 1970 act repealed the 1911 act.\\n 463  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 466}), Document(page_content='So, the significance of this date first January 1912 , is that it tells us that the patent\\napplications if you read section 162 along with rule 37 and section 13 and section 25 (1)\\n(b)B you will get the impression that the 1911 act came into force on the first January of\\n1912 and all the applications filed under that act since the first of January 1912 could be\\nused as documents to prove anticipation.\\nSo, this simply means any specification filed in India which has been published before\\nthe priority date can be used for proving anticipation . (b)B is a ground of anticipation\\nyou can also call it a ground of lack of novelty , there are 4 types of lack of novelty we\\nwill discuss that in detail . Tthis anticipation by a prior published document is one type of\\nlack of novelty challenge. So, (b)B (i)1 simply says any document filed in India that is\\nsince 1912 can be used to challenge the claim of an application. So, though (b) does not\\nstart  by saying  anticipation , we  understand  it  has  not as  an  ground  for  anticipation\\nbecause the language any claim has been published before the priority date is something\\nits published before the priority date , it anticipates the invention . Nnow that is (b)B (i)1-\\n(b)B (ii)2 says in India or elsewhere in any other document ..\\nNow, this covers the world . (i)one only said specification made in India after 1912 which\\nmeans right from the first patent have specification made in India you could look into the\\nspecification for determining anticipation . (ii)2 covers the entire world anything above\\nthat which is any document in India or elsewhere . Tthis relates to section 13 (2) India or\\nelsewhere you will find the same mention in section 13 ( 2). anything any material if the\\ninvention is covered in any other document in India or elsewhere which means the entire\\nworld can also anticipate.\\nSo, anticipation by specifications filed in the Indian patent office are covered in (b)B (i)1\\nand  b  (ii)2 covers  any document  prior publication , means  prior  publication  by any\\ndocument , prior claiming alone means the claim should be claimed in another document.\\nSo, prior publication and prior claiming are 2 types of anticipation , (ii)2 covers prior\\npublication , and in anticipation the Indian patent office, like most other patent office  is\\nfollows a global standard . Wwe can look into documents from any country it need not be\\na patent document it could also be a non patent documents.\\nSo, any other document means any document other than a specification and India and\\nelsewhere covers the entire world. So, we have an absolute standard for novelty what is\\n 464  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 467}), Document(page_content='called the absolute novelty standard . Rregardless of what is filed in India , the Indian\\npatent office can look at any prior art to challenge the novelty of an application . Tthe\\nproviso deals with instances where a publication does not constitute anticipation by\\nvirtue of 29 (2) or by virtue of 29  (3), 29 (2) and 29 (3) we will come to it in greater\\ndetail, but for the time being you need to understand that there are certain instances\\nwhere certain publication that you do will not amount to anticipation you could make\\ncertain publications and follow up with a patent application at a later point and time and\\nstill get the benefit of this period you can call it a grace period . Iin India , there is a grace\\nperiod , the grace period allows you to make a publication and follow it up with an\\napplication for a patent within one year in most occasions its one year.\\nSo, India has a grace period and this nearly says that if a publication was made during\\nthat grace period that cannot be used as ground for anticipation. So, when we come to 29\\nwe will look at 29 ( 2) and 29 3. So, any publication that can be used to challenge a patent\\nunder ( b) should not fall under section 29 (2) and section 29 ( 3). So, the cross reference\\nto this provision is section 29 (2) and section 29 (3). So, as we mentioned this is a one of\\nthe grounds of anticipation and anticipation is link to the concept of novelty. So, when\\nwe say something is anticipated , we mean something lacks novelty , the claim lacks\\nnovelty.\\n(Refer Slide Time: 20:08)\\n 465  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 468}), Document(page_content='See the invention. (c) the invention s So, far as claimed in any claim of a complete\\nspecification this entire  freeze  phrase  can be summarized as the claimed invention or\\nwhat is claimed or in just we can say the claim the claim in the application.\\nThe claim in the application is claimed in a claim of a complete specification published\\non  or  after  the  priority  date  of  the  applicants  claim  and  filed  in  pursuance  of  an\\napplication for a patent in India , being a claim of which the priority date is earlier than\\nthe applicants claim . Nnow, you will remember that when we were discussing section\\n13; 13 ( 1) (b). wWe had seen a situation where a claim in any claim of a complete\\nspecification  published  on or after  the date  of filing,  but having  an earlier  priority\\nclaiming a priority earlier than that day. Now, this is what we call anticipation by a\\npending application , normally for something to anticipate the thing has to be published\\nand only you can to get the benefit of anticipation the document on which you are going\\nto compare the claim has to be in the public domain , it has to be already published.\\nBut in patent law , we understand that there is a domain dormant period . Wwhat we call\\nthe period during which the application is not published normally it is 18 months that is a\\ndefault domain dormant period. So, if, but the domain dormant period does not accept\\nthe priority , the domain dormant period though the application is not published still the\\npriority is preserved. So, if assume that a person files an application on Jan first 1 2017,\\nanother person files a similar application on Feb first 1 2017.\\nAnd let us also assume that they are almost verbatim though they did not have the benefit\\nof each application , there are almost verbatim , they map on each other . Tthe person who\\nfiles the Feb application would not have the benefit of the Jan first application when if it\\nhe  does a prior art search . Tthe Jan first application  in normal  course  we  will get\\npublished only after 18 months and any prior art search is going to throw you documents\\nthat have been published after 18 months of its filing.\\nSo, there is always a gap in your prior art no matter how effective your prior art searches\\nit cannot come it cannot or it will not throw the documents that remain unpublished. So,\\nthis is the gap and everybody understands this, but nevertheless from the viewpoint of\\nthe patent office , if there is a prior art , in the intervening period the prior art has be\\nconsidered. So, this provision allows the controller to look at documents which were\\n 466  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 469}), Document(page_content='published later, but which had an earlier priority because world over the patent office is\\nfollow the rule of first 2 file whoever filed first will get the patent.\\nSo, if 2 people  mailed  parallel  inventions  they found they came  up with the same\\ninvention and they filed. One filed in January and the other person filed in February , the\\nperson who filed later , when the January publication gets published that can be used as\\nprior art. So, that is what is mentioned here and in 13 also you have that situation. So,\\nmany a times people ask hypothetical questions about what happens if 2 inventions are\\ninvented by 2 people in a different place, but they did not know about it the answer is\\nwhoever files first gets the patent and this is the reason the stamp of the patent office also\\nhas a time stamp it not only acknowledges a time the dat ea on which the application was\\nreceived there is also a time stamp and by the time stamp we will get to know who is\\nprior and in time.\\nThe applicants claim has been claimed in another specification which was published\\nafter the priority date, but which had an earlier priority. So, how we will this happen this\\nwill happen because of the dormant period the 18 month period , applications are not\\npublished, but nevertheless  if somebody filed  an application  on the same  invention\\nbefore you , he will get the patent and the controller can rely on that. And understand that\\nby  the  time  pre  grant  opposition  is  filed  all  applications  are  published , the  Feb\\napplication would have been published because otherwise a person cannot challenge it ,\\nand the other application the Jan application would have also been published by that\\ntime.\\nThen the applicant who filed the Jan application or any person who wants to sight the Jan\\nJanuary application can sight it to challenge the latter filed applications . Ok, tthis again is\\na  kind  of  anticipation  we  refer  to  this  anticipation , as  anticipation  by  a  pending\\napplication . (dD) the  invention .  sSo,  far  as  claimed  in  any  claim  of  a  complete\\nspecification was publicly known or publicly used in India before the priority date of the\\nclaim , this is the third kind of anticipation , this is anticipation by public knowledge or\\npublic use . Aanticipation by public knowledge or public use is where the invention that\\nyou have claimed was known publicly or it was used publicly.\\nSo, public knowledge and public use need may not be through documents , whereas , in\\n(b) and (c) either we were looking at a complete specification in (b) or we were looking\\n 467  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 470}), Document(page_content='at any other document again a published document in (c) we were looking at a complete\\nspecification again. So, in (b) and (c) all the documents that we had to compare or we\\nhad to look at to determine anticipation were published documents and it  is’s easy to map\\na publisher document with a claim  d.\\n(d)  h However ,  cover  something  beyond  published  documents  something  that  has\\npublicly known or publicly used say a particular technology a machine was publicly used\\nin India , you could use that to challenge a claim if you are able to prove that machine\\nactually encompass  the  invention  that  is  now covered in the claim , or there  was a\\ndisclosure of the invention say in a conference publicly and people knew about the\\ninvention publicly. But there was no record of it, it was not documented , it was not\\nwritten , it was not captured , it was not video graphed , assume that it was not recorded in\\nanyway, but a group of people knew it , in those cases you will have to produce evidence\\nto show that people knew it.\\nA  news  report  showing  that  the  event  happened , a  news  report  showing  that  the\\ndescription of the event , or you could even file affidavits before the controller saying\\nthat. sSo, and . sSo, was there in the conference he and . sSo, many other people were\\nthere , they all understood this to be the invention. So, this invention should not be\\ngranted. So, public knowledge publicly known or publicly used public use the burden of\\nproof maybe different from merely producing a document.\\nSo, if the knowledge or use was not available in a published form , still you can prove\\nthese things, but you will have to adduce evidence of a different kind . Wwe will have to\\nask people to file affidavits its slightly different from what you saw in (b) and (c). Iin b\\nand c,  we were only looking at documents either specification or any other document ,\\nhere it need s not be a document . Aas I mentioned , if a machine was used publicly in\\nIndia. And it was not recorded in any document you could still file affidavits from people\\nand you could prove it through the evidence of people who had witnessed it , people who\\nare had known it , people who are have seen it being used or people who had used it.\\nThis is an explanation to (d) for by the purpose of this clause an invention relating to the\\nprocess for which a patent is claimed shall be deemed to have been publicly known or\\npublicly used in India before the priority date of the claim, if the product made by that\\n 468  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 471}), Document(page_content='process had already been imported in into India before the date except where such\\nimportation has been for a purpose for reasonable trail or experiment only.\\nNow it simply means for understanding publicly known or publicly used we will also\\nconsider imported things something that was imported, and it was publicly known still it\\nwill be considered as a part of public knowledge or public use it need not be an invention\\nthat was developed in India it need not be something which people in India made it even\\nthings that are imported can be considered, but the only exception is if the thing that was\\nimported was important for reasonable trial or experiment only say there was a machine\\nthat was used to excavate the land to drill holes into the ground.\\nJust was used This was used  brought into India nobody made that machine, but this was\\nonly on a reasonable trial , say the Indian government wanted to know whether they can\\ndrill a type of rock whether it can be used for drilling a rock they tried it they found that\\nit was not successful or it was too expensive or they had issues and they sent it back.\\nNow that can be regarded as a reasonable trail  trial  or experiment it is not large scale\\ncommercial use . Tthus such uses cannot be used for challenging novelty again, like the\\ngrace period that we saw this is an exception that is given similar exceptions are there\\nthroughout the patents act .

So, if an aircraft came and landed in India and there\\nwas a patented part inside the aircraft you cannot file a case of infringement for the\\nsimple reason that the aircraft which will live leave India , we do not call that commercial\\noperation it is not that that machine was made or copied or disseminated within India in\\nthe vessel or the aircraft or the vehicle came to India and it just left and just to bring an\\nanalogy from section 49. Similarly, something which came into India by importation, but\\nfor reasonable tr ialailer or experimentation, and which eventually left India cannot be the\\nground for an anticipation challenge.\\n 469  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 472}), Document(page_content='(Refer Slide Time: 32:20)\\n(Refer Slide Time: 32:29)\\nNow, we come to (e) that the invention so far as claimed in any invention of a complete\\nspecification is obvious or clearly does not involve inventive step having regard to the\\nmatter published as mentioned in (b) or having regard to what was used in India before\\nthe priority date of the applicants claim .

So, if you  do not don’t  describe the method of performing the\\ninvention or making the invention or what you have described the complete specification\\nis not sufficient in its description or it is not clear in its description that can be a ground\\nfor challenge . Tthere is a concept in patent law that a disclosure made in a specification\\nshould be enabling disclosure.\\nNow, this is the provision that can be used to say that there is no enabling disclosure , the\\ndisclosure should be sufficient and clear and describing the invention and the method in\\nwhich it is perform , if it is not sufficient and clear , and a person who reads it does not\\n 473  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 476}), Document(page_content='understand how to do it , then you can say that the specification has not made an enabling\\ndisclosure , there is disclosure, but it does not enable the person to make the invention .\\nNnow this is the requirement under the patents act that the 20 year exclusivity is granted\\nin return of the patentee , the inventor teaching the invention.\\nSo, that is why you find the prior or art teache rs you find that language that has got into\\nthe patent law jurisprudence the prior art teaches this particular aspect of the invention\\nthat is because, patents have a teaching element when you file a patent you get a 20 year\\nexclusivity in return you will have to teach the people how to do this invention.\\nSo, you  cannot  can’t  file an  unambiguous patent or an obscure patent without clear\\ndetails in it and expect to have a 20 year exclusivity the question arises in an ambiguous\\npatent where nothing is clear nobody reads and understands it what did you teach others\\nwe do not don’t  say somebody has thought someone or somebody has thought somebody\\na way to do it if the person who to whom it is addressed did not understand. So, a part of\\nteaching is that the person who receives the knowledge , understands how to do it.\\nSo, if that element is not there we would say that he has not taught that person , he did not\\nteach that person how to do it for instance there are certain things which do not don’t\\ncome to human beings naturally like swimming ,; swimming has to be thought taught . So,\\nin swimming if you go for a class to an instructor and after a long period of time , say 3\\nmonths , you are still not able to swim , you cannot say that the instructor taught you\\nswimming because you have not learnt it you are not still not able to do it and this\\nrepeatedly say a person wrote a book on how to swim just no practical experience a book\\non how to swim and many people brought that book and they tried and nobody was able\\nto swim based on reading that book.\\nWe cannot say that the book has thought taught people how to swim , enabling disclosure\\nrequires a person to teach the invention in such a way people can perform it people can\\ncome up with the invention. So, if a person cannot come up with the invention he would\\nsay that there is no enabling disclosure made and he will use this ground if he is a pre\\ngrant opponent to say that the specification does not sufficiently or clearly describe the\\ninvention or the method by which it is to be performed . Nnow just applied apply to the\\nswimming analogy the disclosure does not allow me to do what you are teaching me\\nwhat you teaching me you are teaching me to swim it does not help me to do that. So, if\\n 474  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 477}), Document(page_content='the disclosure does not allow a person to do what the invention claims to be , this ground\\ncan be used.\\nSo, we understand this has an internal requirement , it is an internal ground , there is no\\ncomparison no prior art involved , there is no conduct involved , you see that conduct the\\nbehavior of a person wrongfully obtained could be a ground for challenge , this is no\\nconduct  involved  this  is  no  prior  document  or  prior  art  document  or  any  kind  of\\ndocument that needs to be compared here  it is  this is why we call this is an internal\\nrequirement , we call this sufficiency in patent law this ground is called sufficiency.\\nSufficiency  is  an  internal  ground  it  has  to  be  proved  its  a  requirement  that  the\\nspecification has to satisfy . each that the  (h)  applicant had failed to disclose to the\\ncontroller the information required by section 8 or has furnished the information which\\nin any material particular was falls to his knowledge. Now the cross reference to this\\nsection 8 we had already seen that section 8 requires you to make certain information’s\\nregarding foreign applications foreign filing to the patent office.\\nSo, if the applicant has failed to make that disclosure and the corresponding form is form\\n3. So, you file form 3 to make the disclosure under section eight. So, the corresponding\\nreference should be form 3. So, if a person does not file a form 3 that could be ground for\\nRevoca ground for opposition under this ground or he has filed form 3 he has furnish ed\\nthe information which in any material particular was false to his knowledge. Now he said\\nthat an application which I filed in Australia has been granted the opponent files that it is\\nnot been granted it is actually been rejected the opponent can reach the ground to say that\\nhe file form 8 saying he got a grant in Australia, but his Australia was actually rejected\\nshowing the relevant documents showing that it is been rejected from the Australian\\npatent office website.\\nSo,  this  is  the  ambit  of  section  8  section  8  is  not  on  the  substantial  merit  of  the\\napplication it has nothing to do with comparing it with an external document it is again\\non the conduct of the applicant the applicant did not do didn’t do something or he with\\ndid  something, but what he  disclosure  disclosed  the patent office was wrong. So, that\\ncould be a ground for. So, so again patents can be revoked applications can be opposed\\nnot just on its substantial merit it can also be revoked based on the behavior of the\\nconduct of the applicant. So, this is the second ground which we see have seen which\\ngoes to the conduct of the applicant . \\n 475  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 478}), Document(page_content='(i)I that in the case of a convention application the application was not made within 12\\nmonths from the date of the first application for protection for the invention made in a\\nconvention country by the applicant or a person from whom he d erives title.\\nNow, in the case of a convention application which enters India the application in India\\nhas to be made within 12 months of making the first application that is a what that’s what\\nwe call the basic application. Now if the 12 month period is not kept , it can be a ground\\nfor challenge , the  analytic  analogy is  similar  to what we saw in section 9 ( 1) if a\\nprovisional specification is filed if it is not followed within 12 months by a complete the\\nprofessional is treated as abandoned if a complete is filed after 12 months the complete .\\nWe  will not get the benefit of the provisional, because the provisional is treated as\\nabandoned  in  a  same  way  the  convention  application  has  to  be  followed  by  an\\napplication in India within 12 months . Iif the 12 month period is not maintained that can\\nbe a ground for challenge. Again this is going on the conduct it is not on the substantial\\nmerit of the application it has nothing to do with comparing it with a prior art document\\nthe applicant for whatever reason he will didn’t do a particular thing on time.\\nSo, that again comes to is conduct how the applicant behaved when we say conduct we\\nare referring to how the applicant behaved and the behavior of the applicant can lead to a\\ndismissal . it It maybe a procedural behavior , it is not that we are not alleging that by this\\nthe applicant can be deemed to have been committed some fraud on the patent office , it\\nisthat’s  not the thing, but the applicant was required to do something and he did not do it\\nin that fashion. So, again the third ground going back to the conduct of the applicant.\\n 476  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 479}), Document(page_content='(Refer Slide Time: 49:48)\\n(j)J where the complete specification does not disclose or wrongly mentions  this  the\\nsource of geo geographical origin of biological material used in the invention .

So, all the grounds where something is an attack on a claim like\\nand lack of novelty attack or a lack of inventive step attack you will see those grounds\\nwill begin with the language the invention. So, far has claimed any in any claim of a\\ncomplete specification.\\nSo, that is an attack on the claim whereas, if you see (j) the complete specification does\\nnot disclose its an attack on the descriptive part of the complete specification. So, you\\ncan see that the specifications or a patent application can be attacked some attacks are on\\nthe claim some attacks are the complete specification itself some attacks are on the\\nbehavior of the person something that did not didn’t happen on time.\\nSo, you can classify all the grounds based on whether it was an attack on the way the\\napplicant behaved whether it was an attack on the way the patent was drafted which goes\\nback to the specification whether it was an attack on the claim. So, all anticipation\\ngrounds by which I mean lack of novelty grounds and lack of inventive step grounds are\\nattacks on the claim , which tells us to prove novel lack of novelty or lack of inventive\\nstep you have to compare the claims .

He is not a formal party and the proceedings are\\nnot regarded as proceedings between two parties a pre grant opposition is not regarded as\\na proceeding between the opponent and the applicant, it is not.

And the grant of the patent has multiple\\nmeanings it could be as granted at the patent office it could be the certificate that is\\nissued to the patentee that could also it is also part of the grant it could be the publication\\nof the grant in the official journal.\\n 488  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 491}), Document(page_content='So, here what is being referred to as grant of a patent is the publication of the grant in the\\nofficial journal.

(h)H the patentees\\nfail to disclose information under section  (8) that is filing of form  three  3  or he has\\nfurnished information which is in any material particular was false to his knowledge.\\nAgain we mention this as a ground that is tied to the conduct of a patentee in pre grant\\nthis tied to the conduct of an applicant in this case it is straight to the conduct of a\\npatentee.\\n 491  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 494}), Document(page_content='(Refer Slide Time: 09:51)\\nIn case of the patent granted on convention application the application was not made\\nwithin 12 months of the first application or the basic application, this is preserving the\\ntimeline in filing international application. So, if a basic application was preferred abroad\\nand it is followed up by a convention application and it enters India through a convention\\napplication the timeline of 12 months was not honored or the patentee filed beyond 12\\nmonths.\\nNow, this becomes a ground  up  of opposition in post grant means that the patent has\\nalready  been  granted  the  patent  office  has  overlooked  the  fact  that  the  convention\\napplication timeline was not kept, but still it is open for the post grant opponent to raise\\nthis as a ground. So, that if the patent office had by oversight granted the pattern it could\\nbe a ground for revocation.  (J) the patent specification does not disclose or wrongly\\nmentions the source and geographical origin of the biological material,  (k) what was\\nclaimed was anticipated having regard to knowledge oral or otherwise available with any\\nlocal  or indigenous  community in India or elsewhere what could  generally we call\\nanticipation by traditional knowledge. But on no other ground it just concludes with a to\\n2 k and it says there cannot be any further ground than these grounds. \\nNow the procedure for post grant opposition  at as we mentioned is different from pre\\ngrant  opposition.  In  pre  grant  you  had  only  one  rule  which  determine  the  entire\\nprocedure ,  we saw that rule 55 was the only rule and earlier there was no form for filing\\n 492  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 495}), Document(page_content='a pre grant opposition, but after the 2016 amendments to the patent rules they have\\nintroduced form 7  a. So, form 7  a was introduced recently.\\nSo, now you have a form again pre grant opposition is without fees whereas, post grant\\nopposition the procedure is more detailed and you also have payment of fees. Now (3 )\\ntells us about what happens when a post grant opposition is filed 3 ( a), where a notice of\\nopposition is duly given under subsection 2 the controller shall notify the patentee.\\n(Refer Slide Time: 12:20)\\nSo, once a notice of opposition is given the controller will communicate that to the\\npatentee there is no room for the exercise of the controller’s discretion. Whereas in pre\\ngrant opposition we saw that in rule 55  (3)three  it is mentioned that on consideration of\\nthe representation if the controller is of the opinion that the pattern shall be refused or\\ncomplete specification requires amendment he shall give notice to the applicant to that\\neffect. So, the controller’s opinion is important in pre grant opposition he will give notice\\nto the applicant only if the controller forms an opinion that the patent shall be refused or\\nthe complete specification requires an amendment.\\nExercise of his opinion is not required when it comes to post grant, the fact that a post\\ngrant opposition is filed the notice goes to the patentee, (b) on receipt of the notice of\\nopposition the controller shall buy order in writing constitutive a board to be known as\\nthe opposition board consisting of such officers as he may determine or refer to such\\n 493  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 496}), Document(page_content='notice  of  opposition  along  with  the  documents  to  the  board  of  examination  and\\nsubmission of it is recommendations to the controller.\\nNow, this is yet another new feature which is not found in pre grant opposition the\\ncontroller on receipt of notice of opposition has to constitute a board, a board comprising\\nof three examiners,  you  will find the details  of what the board is. Now the board\\ncomprises of examiners who the constitution of the board and it ’s is proceedings are spelt\\nout in detail in rule 56. So, we will come to rule 56 soon. So, this is a significant\\ndeparture in procedure from what we saw in the pre grant opposition, in pre grant\\nopposition  there  are  only  three  entities  to  participate  in  the  proceeding  -  one  the\\ncontroller, two the applicant whose application is in question and three the pre grant\\nopponent.\\nNow, you saw that the grounds of pre grant and post grant are the same. So, the question\\nthat you may ask is that why do we need post grant review because if the grounds are the\\nsame and the office before which the grounds are going to be raised that is a the patent\\noffice continues to be the same what is the need for a post grant opposition because if the\\npatent office  ishas already decided a pre grant and it has come to a decision to ground the\\npatent why should the patent office again entertain on the same grounds and probably on\\nthe same material another opposition.\\nNow to get over that technical objection- probably to get over that technical objection\\nyou now have another layer of review which is through the opposition board. So, in a\\nnormal case there is a controller who issues the statement of first objections there is an\\nexaminer who  assess  assists  the controller and this completes the process, but in post\\ngrant there is an entirely new set of examiners three of them who have not seen the\\napplication before, so they were not a party to the grant, they were not a party to\\nprosecuting the application which happened before the grant there is an entirely new set\\nof people three examiners who constitute the opposition  board  who come up with an\\nopinion on the granted pattern. So, this is the distinguishing feature the grounds are not\\ndistinguishing feature there are three examiners who constitute a board who will now\\ncome to a conclusion as to whether the grounds raised in the notice of opposition have a\\ncase against the patent.\\n 494  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 497}), Document(page_content='So, this is how by looking at the policy and by looking at the law we can justify the\\nexistence of post grant opposition because the grounds are the same, the invention is the\\nsame, the office is the same. The only thing that is going to be different here is that there\\nis  an  extra  layer  of  scrutiny  by  the  opposition  board.  (C) every  opposition  board\\nconstitute an under clause b shall conduct the examination in accordance with such\\nprocedure as maybe prescribed and we saw that the procedure we will soon see that the\\nprocedure is what has been prescribed in rule 56.\\n(4) on  receipt  of  the  recommendation  of  the  opposition  board,  so  the  word\\nrecommendation is important because the function of the opposition board is to make a\\nrecommendation  to  the  controller. So,  when  we  say  the  opposition  board  makes  a\\nrecommendation the opposition board’s recommendation need not be binding on the\\ncontroller because we understand there is a hierarchy in the patent office, the examiner’s\\nreport to the controller. So, the examiner’s report can at best have a recommendatory\\neffect  on  the  controller  it  cannot  be  binding  on  the  controller.  So,  it  is it’s a\\nrecommendation. Just like examiners report will constitute a recommendation to the\\ncontroller  similarly  the  opposition  board  which  is  nothing,  but  a  group  of  three\\nexaminers they would make a recommendation after studying the documents.\\nOn receipt of that recommendation of the opposition board and after giving the patentee\\nand  the opponent  in opportunity of being  heard the  controller  shall  order either  to\\nmaintain or to amend or to revoke the patent. Now these are three things that can happen\\nto any patent whenever an objection is raised, the objection could be raised under section\\n15, the objection could be raised under opposition under 25 (- 1) or a objection could be\\nraised at the patent office under section 25 (– 2). In all these three cases wherever an\\nobjection is raised the patent office can overcome then objection and maintain the patent\\nif the patent is granted, if it is not granted it isit’s  in the application state it meant it may\\ngrant the patent. So, maintain or grant.\\n2 is something is wrong the patent office can ask the applicant or the patentee to amend,\\n3 it can revoke the patent or reject the application. So, maintain amend revoke would\\nalso mean grant amend or reject the application if it isit’s  in the application stage we\\nwould say that three things can happen the controller can  ground  grant  the patent the\\ncontroller can amend the patent, the controller can reject the application. When it is a\\ngranted patent we say that the controller can maintain the patent because it is already\\n 495  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 498}), Document(page_content='granted by overcoming the objections, the controller can amend the patent if something\\nis wrong and something can be corrected or the patent controller can revoke the pattern.\\nSo, on receipt of the recommendation of the opposition board the controller has to hear\\nthe parties the patentee and the opponent and then the controller has to passes order. So,\\nthis is the procedure of a post grant opposition. A notice of opposition is filed with the\\nstatement of opposition and evidences the patentee has an opportunity to reply to that\\nwithin a timeframe if the opponent has rejoined the if yes he has repliedy to the patentees\\nreply he is given time to do that then the controller fixes a date of hearing there is a\\nhearing both the parties are heard and the controller gives an order in writing.\\nNow, before the controller fixes the date of hearing the controller also makes a reference\\nto the opposition board he constitutes an opposition board comprising of three examiners\\nand they submit a report what is called the submit a recommendation to the controller.\\nSo, this is the procedure.\\n(Refer Slide Time: 20:43)\\nFine  (5)  while  passing an order under sub section  four  4  in respect of the ground\\nmentioned in clause d or clause e of subsection 2 the controller shall not take into\\naccount any personal document or secret trial or secret use. Now this is with regard to\\nanticipation  (d) mentions if you look at 25 (- 2) (d) it refers to one of the grounds of\\nanticipation 25 ( - 2)( d) publicly known or publicly used in India anticipation by prior\\nknowledge or prior use.\\n 496  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 499}), Document(page_content='And (e) is inventive step lack of inventive step and in do it this provision mentions that\\nin these two cases the controller shall not take into account any personal document or\\nsecret trial or secret use. Now  secret  trial secret use personal document by which we\\nmean something which is capable of kept as a confidential information. So, anything that\\nis  confidential  between  parties  they  are  bound  by  a  non  disclosure  agreement  or\\nsomething which is not meant for public disclosure like notes kept in a private diary\\nthese things cannot be used for proving anticipation or lack of inventive step.\\nSo, this when we come to section 64 we will see the details of what kinds of personal\\ndocuments are excluded what the is secret trial and secret use and we also have some\\nexceptions in anticipation that if you test something or if you experiment something\\nbefore launching it then that test if it can only be done in a public space like a certain\\ninstruments  can  only  be  used  or  experimented  in  the  public  space  then  there  is  a\\nprotection that comes to you by way of a grace period.\\nSo, in India we do have grace period there is a provision for beta testing things and we\\nalso now have a judgment which says that beta testing software would not disclose or\\nwould not kill the or will not anticipate the invention this is the yahoo case which was\\ndecided by the intellectual property appellate board. So, the controller will exclude any\\npersonal document or secret trail or secret use before determining anticipation by prior\\nknowledge or prior views and determining invented step obviousness or lack of or lack\\nof inventive step.\\n(6), in case the controller issues an order under subsection 4 that the patent shall be\\nmaintained subject to amendment amend of the specification or any other document the\\npatent shall stand amended accordingly. Now whenever the patent is amended the patent\\nin force becomes the amended patent. So, amendments as we know are of different types\\nthere are various amendments that can happen to the application and all those things are\\nnot published because what has published is at the time of grant, but any amendment that\\nhappens after a grant needs to be specially published. So, if you look at the official\\njournal you will also find that amendments carried out after the grant are published. Now\\namendments  carried  out after the  grant  can  come  by various  means  it could come\\npursuant  to  an  objection  raised  under  section  55 ( -  2) post  grant  and  there  is  an\\namendment.\\n 497  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 500}), Document(page_content='But when amendments happen after the grant they need to be separately published. It\\ncould also come in a revocation proceeding under section 64 say that  as the there is a\\nrevocation application filed before the intellectual property appellate board and  post\\nwent pursuant  to the ground raised under section 64 the intellectual property appellate\\nboard amends the patent or allows an amendment and sustains the patent. Now again that\\nshould  be  published  and  when  the  intellectual  property  appellate  board  allows  an\\namendment the patent will be the patent as it stands amended.\\nSo, for all practical purposes for determining infringement for invalidity analysis it will\\nbe the amended patent that will be, that will be considered as the patent in force. So,\\nthat’s is what this statement says the pattern patent shall stand amended accordingly. If\\nthe amendment happens before the controller then it  is’s an in house affair it happens\\nwithin the patent office which is also the fees place  where the register has is kept which\\nis also the place where which publishes the amendments through the official journals.\\nSo,  publishing  the  amendments  done after  the  grant  at  the  patent  office  there  is  a\\nprocedure and it will normally get done, but amendments that happened before the high\\ncourt in an infringement trial where in invalidity counterclaim of invalidity is raised all\\nthe amendments that happened before an itb IPAB in a revocation proceeding needs to be\\ncommunicated. So, many a times even a patent is amended by the intellectual property\\nappellate board you will find a direction to the controller to complete the formalities of\\nthe amendment which means publication correcting the register and other official things\\nwhich the controller would normally do if the amendment way were to happen within the\\npatent office.\\nSo, understand  amendment  after  the  grant can  happen before  the pa trent  office  for\\ninstance under section 25 ( - 2), it can happen in the high court in an infringement suit\\nwhere  the  infringer  that  is  the  defendant  in  the  patent  infringement  suit  raises  a\\ncounterclaim to invalidate the patent and pursuant to the counter claim the court allows\\nthe patent, but in  an  the amended form or the amendment can happen in a revocation\\nproceeding where the IPAB feels that rather than revoking the patent they would allow\\nan amended version of the claim in the patent to survive.

Now we saw that once a notice of opposition is\\nissued the controller will constitute an opposition board, now the details of constitution\\nof the opposition board are mentioned in 56, rule 56. If you look at rule 56, 56 (1) tells us\\nthat on receipt of notice of opposition, the controller by order earlier we saw in writing\\nwhich means there has to be a written order it isit’s an office order, but it is a written\\norder.

Now, 73(2) says  us  that  for the\\npurpose of this act the central government may appoint as many examiners and other\\nofficers and with such designation as it thinks fit.

So, the members of the opposition board\\nshould not have been a party or should not have been a part of the examination process\\nbefore the patent was granted.\\nSo, we understand that in every patent before it gets granted there is a report generated\\nby an examiner under section 12 and 13 that report if an examiner has worked on that\\nreport then he is ineligible he is disqualified from being in the opposition board. This is\\njust to ensure that a fresh set of people, a fresh set of examiners get to look at the case\\nagain.\\n(4), the opposition board shall conduct the examination of the notice of opposition along\\nwith the documents filed under rules 50 to 57 to 60 referred to under sub section 25(3).\\nSubmit a report, so they shall conduct an examination submit a report with reasons on\\neach ground taken in the notice of opposition with their joint recommendation within\\nthree months from the date on which the documents were forwarded to them. So, there is\\na window period there is a report and in the report they shall cover every ground raised\\nand more importantly it has to be a joint recommendation. So, they cannot be split\\nopinions when it says that join recommendation the rules actually want the opposition\\nboard to speak as one it has to be, so that is what they mean by a joint recommendation.\\nWe have  not  seen  instances  where  examiners  dissent  like  how  we  see  dissenting\\njudgements given by judges, but in case there is a decent still the chairman’s vote if the\\nchairman takes we can expect if there are a group of three members we can expect a\\nmajority decision two people may give a decision and one way. So, there could be a\\nmajority decision. So, we have not seen any case to that effect, but when it is mentioned\\nthat it is a joint recommendation the understanding is that the opposition board speaks as\\none even if they don’t speak as one at least there is a majority opinion. So, that is how we\\ncan justify the odd number of examiners constituting the opposition board.\\nSo, the opposition board will look into the documents filed under rules 57 to 60 which is\\nnothing but statement of a position with evidences and reply of the patentee and the\\nrejoinder or what or the opponent files on seeing the counter of the patentee.

The facts upon\\nwhich he basis his case and the relief which he seeks and evidence if any along with the\\nnotice of opposition and shall deliver to the patentee a copy of the statement and the\\nevidence if any.

So, what are the four things that\\nthe written statement should contain? One an opponents interest demonstrating that he is\\na person interested, the facts this should be a description of facts on which he basis case,\\nhe has to claim certain reliefs and he will have to adduce evidence.\\n(Refer Slide Time: 34:22)\\nNow, once this is communicated to the patentee if the patentee desires to contest the\\nopposition, now 58, rule 58 tells us what happens after this is done.\\nThe opponent creates his case, files all the documents and serves a copy to the patentee,\\nit is easy to serve a copy to the patentee because the patentees name can be ascertained\\nfrom the register, you could even go to the patent office website look at the details of\\ngrant and you will find the name and address of the patentee and the agent.

So, when the patentee receives this statement\\nof opposition the patentee can create a reply, now the reply will set out the grounds on\\nwhich the opposition is contested along with the evidence.\\n(Refer Slide Time: 35:29)\\nNow, if a ground of lack of inventive step is raised the reply will try to say that this is not\\nobvious to a person skilled in the art give reasons for that and if the reply wants to rely\\non evidence the evidence will also be there for instance the patentee takes a ground that\\nthis is not obvious to a person in the art because the prior art was teaching in a different\\nway. So, he will list all the prior art before his invention to show that the current teaching\\nwas in a particular way and the invention taught otherwise or the invention word uses\\nteaches away from the prior art.\\nSo, this the patentee will try to demonstrate and insert another objections the patentee\\nwill try to say that the scope of the claim is different and we saw that when we were\\nlooking at sections 17 and 18 we saw that the first approach of a patent attorney whose\\nprosecuting an application will be first to convince the controller to his satisfaction that\\nthe invention is not anticipated. So, the first approach in prosecution is to convince a\\n 503  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 506}), Document(page_content='controller that there is no anticipation, if the controller is not convinced then the second\\nthing you would try to do is to amend your application.\\nSo, how do you convince a controller that to his satisfaction that the invention is not\\nanticipation anticipated you would tell the controller that this is not the relevant prior art\\none way to do it. Secondly, you would say that this could be the relevant prior art, but the\\nclaim in the relevant prior art when it’s interpreted does not fall within the scope of the\\nclaim of your invention. So, you could go on claim interpretation to say that the scope of\\nyour claim is different from the scope of the claim in the prior art. So, that’s another\\napproach.\\nThird approach could be if the facts allow you to do that to show that your priority bi\\nannually your disclosure either in a foreign country or by using the grace period you try\\nto show that this prior art does not affect me because I am prior in time. So, there could\\nbe multiple approaches what you are doing in all these instances are trying to prove to\\nthe satisfaction of the controller that you are not hit by this ground. So, similarly when a\\npatentee responds to a post grant opposition the patentee tries to prove to the satisfaction\\nof the controller that the evidence based on each ground the opponent has raised does not\\naffect (Refer Time: 38:30), does not affect the granted patent. For that he would make a\\nstatement to that effect and also adduce evidence and as I said depending on how you are\\ngoing to prosecute the patent the evidence that you adduce may change.\\nFor instance the objection raised by the opponent is under section 25(2)(f), section 25(2)(\\nf),  allows you to take an objection to an invention under section 3 and section 4. So, if\\nit’s a pharmaceutical patent the patent has been granted and it covers a pharmaceutical\\nsubstance assume that the opponent raises an objection that the patent as it is claimed in\\nclaim is covered under section 3d. The patentee if he has not already done that the\\npatentee can adduce evidence to get over an objection of section 3d and he can give\\nevidence to show that his product or the substance that is covered in his claim has\\nenhanced efficacy compared to the prior art.\\nSo, enhancement of efficacy you need to allow evidence if the evidence is or not already\\nin place. So, we understand evidence by looking at the kind of objection that came from\\nthe opponent. So, the evidence will differ from different grounds and the patentee will\\nhave to counter each ground raised with his statement and with his evidence. So, the time\\n 504  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 507}), Document(page_content='period given for this is two months from the receipt of the written statement from the\\nopponent. So, this the patentee needs to do only if he wishes to contest the opposition.\\nAssume that in a case the patentee after the patent is granted a few years of elapsed\\nthough the patentee has been paying the renewal fee and keeping the patent alive in the\\nlight of an objection the patentee feels that there is no need to keep this patent alive, he\\njust receives the notice of opposition and as a business entity the patentee decides not to\\npursue it. So, a notice of opposition he has received the grounds. So, all the patentee\\nneeds to do is not file a reply if the patentee fails to file a reply then the path post grant\\nopposition will proceed without the involvement of the patentee based on the grounds\\nraised by the opponent and the evidence submitted by him the controller will decide the\\ncase even without the patentee. So, there is a provision for that.\\nSo, it is not that if what happens if the patentee does not respond because the act the rules\\nvery clearly states  that if the patentee  decides  to contest the opposition. So, if the\\npatentee  decides  not  to  contest  the  opposition  he  will  simply  not  respond  to  the\\nopposition notice and the documents and the controller will go by the evidence that has\\nbeen let in.\\n58(2) tells us that if the patentee does not decide to contest or leave his reply the\\nevidence within the period specified the patent shall be deemed to have been revoked.\\nNow, deemed to have been revoked is probably used only once in the act and the rules\\nhere we see deemed to have been abandoned, a deemed to have been withdrawn there are\\nvarious  deeming  provisions  this  is  the  only place  where  a patent  is  deemed  to  be\\nrevoked. So, in the sense that there is a challenge to an existing patent and you do not\\nreply to it the controller will understand that you have given up your patent. So, we had\\nalready mentioned the patent system structure in such a way that any objection that come\\nto you either from the patent office or from a third party if you do not respond to it, it is\\nliterally kind of a defense, if you do not defend the objection that comes there will be\\nvarious deeming provision by which you would be assumed that you had given up your\\nright.\\nSo, we saw that if you do not pay the fees on time, renewal fees is on time then you\\nwould have been deemed to have abandoned your patent, if you do not respond to the\\nobjections raised by the patent office it will be deemed to have been abandoned under\\n 505  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 508}), Document(page_content='section 21, if you do not comply with the timelines stipulated by the controller the\\ncontroller  again deem that you  have abandoned it, if you  do not file a request for\\nexamination the controller will deem that you have withdrawn. So, all these provision\\ntells us that whenever the ball is hit back to the applicant or the patentee there is a\\nresponsibility on the patentee to hit the ball back to the controller or to the whoever\\nraises that objection.\\nIf the applicant or the patentee fails to hit the ball back, so to speak then he loses the\\ngame. So, you understand that the patent system is structured in such a way that the\\nburden is always on the person who will benefit from a grant which is the patentee or the\\napplicant.\\n(59) tells us what happens if the patentee files his reply now if the patentee chooses not\\nto contest it is deemed to be revoked, but he if he contest he files his reply within two\\nmonths and sells copy on the opponent then the opponent gets a chance to file a reply to\\nthe patentee, that is in 59 we see that the opponent may return one month from the date\\nof delivery to him of a copy of the patentees reply statement and evidence under rule 58.\\nLeave at the appropriate office evidence and reply strictly confined to the matters in the\\npatentees evidence and shall deliver to the patentee a copy of such leaves.\\nSo, the scope of the reply is only to the matters that the patentee has raised. So, if there is\\na objection on lack of inventive step which the opponent raised and the only reply on that\\npoint by the patentee is that the prior art teaches in a particular way my invention teaches\\naway from the prior art, then the scope in your reply is going to be only to that argument\\nthat the patentee has raised you cannot start a new case. That is what 59 tells us, you\\ncannot start a new case because you can only give reply strictly confined to matters in\\nthe patentee’s evidence.\\n 506  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 509}), Document(page_content='(Refer Slide Time: 45:25)\\nSo, whatever the patentee ahs said with his evidence you have to strictly confine yourself\\nto that. So, once that happens. So, let us go through the process again there is the\\nopponent files his statement and evidence the patentee in return files his statement and\\nevidence what we call the reply. So, opponent gets one more chance to file his reply to\\nthe patentee’s statement and evidence that completes the process.

Once these three steps are over no\\nfurther evidence shall be delivered by either party except by the leave or direction of the\\ncontroller provided as such leave or direction is sprayed before the controller has fixed\\nthe hearing under rule 62.\\nSo, once the process of exchanging documents and evidence and statement is over you\\ncannot bring in new evidence because that once the controller moves into the hearing\\nmode it will be very difficult for the controller to appreciate new evidence and new\\ndocuments coming in because in most cases documents can be technical in nature it may\\nrequire time to read and understand them and it may also require some work to be done\\nby the controller and by the opposition board.\\nSo, there is a timeline given for (Refer Time: 46:44) adducing evidence. So, once the\\nprocess of submitting documents is over no further evidence shall be delivered the only\\ncase where the controller will allow is cases where the permission of the controller is\\nsought for and the permission has to be sought for before the controller starts the hearing.\\n 507  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 510}), Document(page_content='So, it is very simple to understand because once the controller starts hearing the case or\\nfixes a date for hearing if new documents or new evidence is put in it becomes difficult\\nfor the parties and the controller to read and come up to speed on those documents.\\nSo, (61) tells us that copies of the document to be supplied (1) copies of all documents\\nreferred in the notice of opposition or any statement on evidence filed in connection with\\nthe  opposition  and  authenticated  to  the  satisfaction  of  the  controller  shall  be\\nsimultaneously furnished in duplicate unless the controller otherwise directs.

If he fails to file a reply to the opposition it is\\ndeemed as though he has it is deemed that the patent is revoked, but under 63 if the\\npatentee withdraws the patent that is a conscious act is withdrawing the patent after the\\nnotice of opposition is given and there is no procedure for withdrawing the patent there is\\nno procedure.

Now we saw that in section 25(2)(a) when\\nan invention is wrong fully obtain it can be a ground for opposition. Section 26 deals\\nwith instances covered under section 25(2)(a), section 25(2)(a), covers instances were a\\npatentee or a person under or through whom he claims wrong fully obtain that invention\\nor any part thereof or which means it need not the entire invention it could be certain\\nthings covered in certain claims from him or from a person under through whom he\\nclaims.\\nSo, the opponent if he has a case that the patentee wrong fully obtaining the invention\\nfrom the opponent, he can file a ground for opposition under section 25(2)(a); now where\\n 513  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 516}), Document(page_content='such an opposition is field and the controller comes to a conclusion this is 26 (1) (a) that\\nthe invention that has been claim was obtained from the opponent in a manners set out\\nand clause a of subsection 2 of 25 that is 25(2)(a), and revokes the patent. So, wrong full\\nobtainment as I said is not a substantive ground, it is not based on the merit of the patent\\nthe fact that the patentee did something wrong, he claimed in invention that did not\\nbelong to him the controller can revoke it.\\nSo, it is not based on the substantive merit it is based on the conduct of the patentee, the\\nfact that he filed an application which he was not entitled to is a ground for revocation so\\nthe controller as the power to revoke. Now he may on the request of sub opponent made\\nin the prescribed manner direct that the patent shall stand amended in the name of the\\nopponent. Now this is a slightly different relief normally an opponent files an opposition\\nto destroy the patent, to revoke the patent. Now if the opponents case is that he took the\\ninvention from me, then the opponent may be interested in getting that invention back.\\nSo, this is a provision where a granted patent can be transfered from one person to\\nanother; this is probably the only provision in the patents act. So, if the question is asked\\nunder which proceedings of the patents act can the controller transfer a patent granted\\npatent from one person to another the answer is 26. This is actually transfer of patent\\nbecause your name is going to be substituted as the patentee or you could even word the\\nquestion as under which provision of the patents act can a person substitute his name as\\nthe patentee give the choices 26 will be the answer; even 25 (2) may not be correct\\nbecause 25(2) the relief is only revocation, you saw in 25(4) three things can be done,\\nmaintain amend revoke.\\nTransfer substitution of name is not a power under 25(4). So, the correct answer will be\\n26. So, an opponent who claims that the invention was taken from him has the power to\\nsubstitute his name or request the patent office to substitute his name and the controller if\\nhe is satisfied he can direct the patent to be amended in the name of the opponent . So,\\nagain this is a case where the patentees conduct was bad he actually took something\\nwhich should not belong to him the opponent filed a revocation, but then the opponent\\nsaid that do not revoke the patent I want I am the original one let it come back to be then\\nthe controller will amended.\\n 514  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 517}), Document(page_content='So, this applies only 25(2)(a) tell me why does not apply to 25(1)(a)? Because we said\\nthat the grounds are the same, it does not apply to 25(1)(a) because there is no name\\nsubstitution  that  can  happen  before  the  grant.  Why  should  the  applicant  name  be\\nsubstituted for all you know the it may never materialize into a grant. So, because the\\nright is crystallized in the form of a grant, a persons name is entered into the register the\\nissue of substitution of name comes in, the issue of substitution of name does not come at\\nthe application state because there is no granted right there is nothing to be to substitute\\nonce person’s name to an other. So, that is why the reference in section 26 is to 25(2)(a)\\nand not to 25(1)(a).\\nSo, this is yet another distinction between pre grant and post grant opposition. In post\\ngrant opposition and opponent can actually become the patentee, in pre grant it is not\\npossible. 1(b) a part of the invention described in the complete specification was so\\nobtained  by the  opponent  he may pass  an order  requiring that  the  specification  be\\namended to the exclusion of that part of the invention. As I said if the allegation of the\\ninvention being wrongfully obtain pertains to only one claim or few claims, then the\\ncontroller will strike of those claims revoke those claims because those claims alone\\ncannot be transfered will revoke those claims and allow the patent to continue.\\nSo, if the controller had come to this conclusion after understanding the details of the\\ncase. If after hearing the parties  the controller feels that not the entire invention is\\nwrongfully obtained only a part which is say claim 5 and 6 for instance, 5 and 6 alone\\ncovers what the opponent claims to be his. Now there is no provision for transferring 5\\nand 6 alone to another person. So, the controller will strike of 5 and 6 and grant the\\npatent with the remaining claim because the remaining claims if it is proved that the\\nremaining claims were not wrongfully obtained.

But for\\nall  other purposes  the application  of the opponent shall be proceeded  with as  they\\napplication for a patent under this act. This is a lengthy provision you may have to read it\\nin some detail, now this talks about a situation where the opponent has before the date of\\norder  of  the  controller  requiring  amendment  of  the  complete  specification  under\\nsubsection 1 (b). We said that if part of the invention is covered the controller will ask\\nthe patentee to amend, before he asks the patentee to amend if the opponent has filed an\\napplication. So, first we said that what if the opponent does not have an application if\\nthese claims are dropped they fall into the public domain, but where the opponent has\\nfile an application for a patent, which included the whole or a part of an invention held to\\nhave been obtained.\\nSo, we mention 5 and 6 were wrongfully obtained, but 5 and 6 appears in the application\\nfiled by the opponent thats the case here. Now I told you an instance were 5 and 6 claim\\n 516  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 519}), Document(page_content='5 and claim 6 were wrongfully obtained by the patentee. So, the controller under 26(1)\\n(b) can strike off 5 and 6. Now assume that before he strikes off  5 and 6 there is an\\napplication filed by the opponent which has 5 and 6 (Refer Time: 08:55) for something\\nsimilar to 5 and 6; obviously, because once I know that somebody I am going to make a\\nclaim from somebody that you have taken by invention only a part of my invention, I\\nwill definitely file a corresponding application because I need to protect it, otherwise if\\nthe controller revokes it, it falls into the public domain.\\nSo, this is the part of strategy. So, you could have a question that if you are a post grant\\nopponent and you feel or if you are a person who wants to raise an objection that part of\\nyour invention has been taken by another person and he has been granted a patent. Now\\nwhat could be the safe guards that you take a b c d in one of the choices you can mention\\nthat you will file a patent for covering claims for what he has obtained and then file an\\nopposition under 25(2) that will be the best answer. Because if you file an opposition\\nunder 25 (2) without filling your own application then if the claims are struck off under\\n25 (2) (a) you will not get it. Because your case is that only a part of the invention has\\ntaken are you able to understand only a part of your invention is taken if you don’t have a\\nparallel application then the controllers strikes off revokes it, he amends and he allows\\nfor the patent to continue without your part of the invention in how do you claim it.\\nSo, this safe guard is that you should file an application before you contest the post grant\\nagain this is the practice tip which you should advise an opponent. Any opponent who\\ncomes and says the part of a my invention is taken, that way simply to file you will get\\nall the priority date because the opponent has preserved all the priority for you, now let\\nus see how this proceeds. The controller may treat such application and specification in\\nso far as they relate to the invention held to have been obtained as having been filed for\\nthe purposes of this act relating to the priority days of the dates of the claims of the\\ncomplete specification. \\nWhich  simply  means  though  you  have file  the  application  just before  filing  in the\\nopposition, you will get the priority date as on the day on which the patentee filed that\\nparticular claim you will get that priority. The controller may treat such application\\nrelating to the priority dates on the date on which the corresponding document was or\\ndeemed to have been filed by the patentee. So, you get the instants which we 5 and 6\\nclaims are there which you allege that the patentee has wrongfully obtained and you file\\n 517  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 520}), Document(page_content='an application for 5 and 6 claim at a later point in time, you get the benefit of the\\npatentee’s priority.\\nYou see that they could be a question a very tricky question on antedating based on this\\nprovision you understand that because here the antedating happens into two different\\ndocuments. If you raise this question I really will be interested in seeing how many\\npeople  can  answer  that  because  you  could  say there  is  an  earlier  document  which\\ndisclosed claims 5 and 6 which had a priority, there is a later application filed by a\\ndifferent person and because he raised a section 25 (2) objection stuck of the claims 5\\nand 6 as we have mentioned in the hypothetical sample and he accords the priority to the\\nearlier date. So, actually his antedating the opponents application to the date of the\\npatentees application.\\nSo, you just read the provision again on the date on which the corresponding document\\nwas or was deemed to have been filed by the patentee in the earlier application, but for\\nall  other  purposes  the  application  of  the  opponent  shall  be  proceeded  with  as  an\\napplication for a patent under the act. So, for the priority purpose alone which means\\nthose to claims 5 and 6 though they were filed at a different point in time, gets the\\npriority from an other document in this case not filed by the applicant at all.\\n(Refer Slide Time: 13:16)\\nThere is a corresponding rule 63 (a) request under section 26 (1) shall be made in form\\n12, form 12 within three months from the date of the order of the controller and shall be\\n 518  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 521}), Document(page_content='accompanied by the statement setting on the facts upon which the petitioner relies and\\nthe relief he claims.

The controller shall subject to the provisions of the section cause him to be\\nmentioned as inventor in any patent granted in pursuance of the application, in the\\ncomplete specification and in the register of patent.\\nSo, if a person is an inventor and his name is not mentioned in the column of an inventor\\nand you know inform one you have to mention who the inventor is, if there are multiple\\ninventors all the inventors name have to be mentioned them status of an inventor is\\ndifferent from the status of an applicant there are cases where the inventor can be the\\napplicant, but these two work two different entities. The inventor is a person who comes\\nup with the invention for the first time that is why he is called a true and first inventor,\\nwhere as an applicant is the person who owns the invention and who is entitled to apply\\nfor a grant of a patent. In a case where the inventor is also the applicant then the\\ninventors name will appear in the invention column of form 1, his name will also appear\\nin the applicant column or assign a column in form 1.\\nNow, you will see that form 1 clause 4 gives the place where you have to enter the names\\nof the inventors that’s mandatory; you cannot file a form 1 without having the inventors\\nname in it, and clause 3a you have to mention the applicants. So, these are two different\\nentities the person who is an applicant need not be an inventor there are cases where the\\ninventor assigns his invention to the applicant, and the applicant can file the application\\nand perceive the application.\\nThe inventor necessarily has to have a connection with the creation of the invention, that\\nis  a  requirement  under  law  that  an  invention  should  have  some  connection  to  the\\ninvention to the creation of the invention, that is why you find in 28(1) a there is a\\nmention of that the person being an inventor of the invention or of a substantial part of\\nthat invention, which means the creation of the invention was a group endeavor there\\nwere others to joint inventors and together they came up with the invention.\\nNow 28 does not deal with ownership disputes, you need to be very clear on that 28 does\\nnot deal with ownership dispute because the status of an inventor is not considered as the\\nstatus of their owner. The inventor is a person who comes up with the invention unless\\nthe inventor is shown as an applicant only then he becomes the owner. So, there are cases\\nwhere the inventor whose name is mentioned maybe an employ of an organization or a\\n 521  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 524}), Document(page_content='company, he may be a scientist working in a laboratory or a research organization, in all\\nthose cases the invention has to bear the name of the inventor. The inventor’s names has\\nto be mentioned there is no other way than mentioning the inventors name. But the\\napplicant could be the person to whom the inventor has assigned the invention it could be\\nthe research organization, it could be the lab, it could be the corporation or the company\\nfor which the inventor had worked. The applicant this regarded as the owner of the\\ninvention and the inventor is regarded as the creator of the invention, these two are two\\ndifferent statuses under the patents act.\\nAn analogy would be that of an author and a publisher under the copyrights act. Now we\\nunderstand that very clearly a person who authors the book need not be the publisher;\\nwhere as a publisher in most cases is in body corporate which may act through its\\nemployees and offices. So, the publisher owns the publication because the publisher\\ntakes the right from the author, the publisher gets to distribute and commercialize the\\npublication. Whereas the author is the creator of the work the author creates the work and\\nit  is  the  publisher  who  handles  everything  else,  dissemination,  publication\\ncommercialization of the written or artistic work.\\nSimilarly, this status of an inventor is to create because of the fact that he had created the\\ninvention, the law will always attribute him as the inventor through that is a right which\\nnobody can take away from the inventor. Just as if you wrote a book you will always be\\nattributed as it’s author, you may not make any money out of it, you may have assign the\\ncopyright to somebody else, but still you have a right to be mentioned as the author as\\nlong as the book exists. So, in patent law the inventor has a right to be mentioned as the\\ninventor as long as the patent exists. So, the correction that the controller will do is he\\nwould  mention  that  person  as  an  inventor  in  the  application  for  the  complete\\nspecification that is one place where he will make the correction and in the register of\\npatents.\\nSo, the controller will correct the record in two places, in the complete specification that\\nis form 1 and form 2 and also in the register of patents. And as I mentioned before this\\ndoes not affect the rights of owners, the mere mention of an inventors name does not\\naffect the right of the owners because applicants are the owners of the patent. Provided\\nthat the mention of any person has invented under section shall not confer or derogate\\nfrom any rights under the patent this is what I just mentioned that it will not confer or\\n 522  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 525}), Document(page_content='derogate from any rights under the patent. When we say any rights under the patent we\\nare talking about the rights  as a owner. The owners right does not get affected  by\\nmentioning a person has an inventor, right of co-owners as discussed in section 50 of the\\npatent side. So, this in this provision we are not even talking about the rights of the co\\nowners, we are only on the point of a person who invented the invention  was not\\nmentioned as the inventor he can request to the controller to have his name mentioned as\\nthe inventor.\\n28(2) a request that any person shall be mentioned as aforesaid may be made in the\\nprescribed manner the form for that is form 8 you can see the cross reference there by the\\napplicant for the patent or with a person alleged to be the inventor is not the applicant or\\none of the applicants by the applicant and that person. So, the person who can file form 8\\nis either the applicant himself and if the applicant is also the inventor then it is a clear\\ncase, there is a probably a clerical error where the invention was not mentioned then the\\napplicant can request this change to be made or where the person alleged to be the\\ninventor is not the applicant now this is where I mentioned the fact that the you are in\\ninventor you are right is that of a creator where as the applicant is the owner.\\nSo, you could create something and assign it to somebody else as we will most likely\\nhappen in large organizations where the employees create the invention and because of\\ntheir employment contract the all the invention they come up with will now west with the\\nemployer.

So, he\\nwill call the applicant, he will call the inventor, he will call any other person who may be\\ninterested they may be other people whom the controller may feel they maybe other joint\\ninventors the controller can call any person and here that person.

Now this is one case where the controller can issue a certificate the certificate\\nis this subsection 7 comes into play after a proceeding under subsection 2 or subsection 3\\nhas happened. Does a proceeding that has happened the controller as corrected and added\\na name of an inventor as an inventor that proceeding has already happened under 2 or\\nunder 3 a person’s name has been added. \\nNow another person feels that this person is not the inventor, his name has been wrongly\\nadded then he can approach the controller at any time for a certificate saying that this\\nperson’s name was wrongly added, and they will be a hearing and the controller will call\\nall the necessary parties and then issue the certificate saying that we understand the\\ncertificate as a written document, specifying that the person’s name was wrongly added\\nand now it has been removed and if he issues that certificate then he will have to correct\\nthe specification and the register; because these where the two places he mentioned then\\ninventor, we have rectification before the intellectual property appellate board, this is a\\nrectification process before the controller.\\nSo, there could be a question, how  do you  rectify a person whose name  has been\\nmentioned as the inventor under section 28, but you are aggrieved or you feel that that\\nneeds to be corrected what is the procedure to be followed.

The  form  under  which  28(2)\\nproceedings is initiated is form 8. The same form is used for initiating proceeding under\\n28(3). So, you need to understand in 28 there are different proceedings 28(2) is where the\\napplicant alone or applicant jointly with the inventor can apply, in 28(3) any other person\\nwho is neither the applicant nor the inventor the aggrieved inventor can apply. So, in\\nboth cases you use form 8. Rule 67(1) tells us that a claim under 28(3) shall be made in\\nform 8 and shall be accompanied by a statement setting of the circumstances under\\nwhich the claim is made because the statement and claim is not required under a 28(2)\\nproceeding because they are connected parties, you are either an applicant or the alleged\\ninventor.\\nSo, you are connected to the proceeding. In 28(3) it is a third party you was making it\\nthat is why we require a statement. So, the difference between rule 66 and 67 is that\\nbecause 67 is involves a third party a statement setting of the circumstances is required.\\n67(2) a copy of the claim and the statement shall understand by the controller to every\\napplicant for the patent not being the claimant, and to any other person whom the\\ncontroller may consider to be interested. So, once in 23 proceeding he shall sell copy to\\nall the parties interested including the every applicant if and any party who may be\\ninterested.\\n 527  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 530}), Document(page_content='(Refer Slide Time: 17:53)\\nNow, we saw  the  this  certificate  28(7) talks  about  a  certificate  its  one  of  the  few\\nprovisions, where you can rectify a error the controller has power to make clerical errors\\nhe has power to correct mistakes and clerical errors controller generally has a power, but\\nprocess of rectification like filing a petition and getting something rectified, this is one of\\nthe provisions where you can rectify, and by rectification we mean something else is on\\nrecord and you want to correct that.\\nSo,  this  certificate  operates  like  a  rectification  procedure,  and  if  you  compare  the\\nlanguage of this provision 28(7) with the language in section 71, which is rectification of\\nthe register, this proceeding will also result in the rectification of the register because\\neventually the controller will have to rectify the specification and the register. Now you\\nwill see that the appellate board can be approached by an aggrieved person in the absent\\nor omission from the register of an entry, by any entry made into the register without\\nsufficient cause, by any entry wrongly remaining in the register or by any error or defect\\nin the entry in the register.\\nSo, the register can be corrected and we are talking about all these instances after the\\ngrant and 28 you saw 28 has to be done before the grant. So, the question if somebody\\nask that a person is wrongly mentioned as he inventor, but the patent is granted what are\\nhis options. You see that a person is wrongly mentioned as the inventor and a patent has\\n 528  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 531}), Document(page_content='been granted what are his option file 28(2), because he knows the applicant the applicant\\nis willing to help or if the applicant is not willing to well he files 28(3) as a third party.\\nThen section 71 proceeding before the IPAB all those choices. So, now, you know that\\n28 is where it comes into play before the grant, after the grant naturally the question\\ncomes what if something happens and how do your 71 is the answer. So, in 68 again for\\nthe certificate no 68 pertains to 28(7) which is to rectify an error which has already been\\ncarried out, and the person who request is asking for a he is asking for a certificate. So,\\nhe does the same thing he files form 8 and because he is a third party there is a statement.\\nSo, understand that a statement is required when you have already not a party to the\\nproceeding,  you  are  a  third  party  a  statement  is  required.  Applicant  no  statement\\napplicant  along with the aggrieved inventor no statement  required.  So, statement  is\\nrequired because you are a third party entering into the proceeding, now they could be\\nanother  question  in  how  many  proceedings  under  the  patents  act  can  third  parties\\nintervene before the grant of a patent.\\nWe saw under 25(1) third parties can intervene any person, this 28(7) and 28(3) are two\\ninstances where a person interested a third party can intervene in to the prosecution, that\\nis more important because normally we understand a prosecution as an as a proceeding\\nbetween the controller others a patent office and the applicant. Third parties are normally\\nnot allowed a third parties may be allowed in some cases and this is yet another case\\n28(3) and 28(7) all instances where third parties may be alone. So, the choices could be\\n28(3), 28(7), 25(1) and so on.\\n68(2) tells us that a copy of the application and the statement shall be sent by the\\ncontroller to each patentee or applicant for patent as the case may be and to any other\\nperson whom the controller make considered to be interested. From the language of 68\\n(2) you can understand that there is a small detail in 68. 68 (2) tells us that a copy of this\\napplication and the statement shall be sent by the controller to each patentee or the\\napplicant for patent as the case may be, which means 28 (7) can be instituted even after\\nthe grant of a patent.\\nBecause the otherwise the status of a patentee will not be mentioned here and in fact, the\\nprovision that we saw in 28(4). 28(4) covers 28(2). and 28(3)., because 28(4). says a\\nrequest or claim under the foregoing provisions that is 28(2) and 28 (4) of the section\\n 529  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 532}), Document(page_content='shall be made before the grant of a patent. 28(2) and 28(3) alone pertain to before the\\ngrant of a patent 28(7) proceeding can be anytime, the certificate can be anytime because\\nrule tells us that a notice can be issued even to the patentee which mean the patent has\\nbeen granted at that stage. So, so that needs to be checked that 28(7) is not a proceeding\\nbefore grant, 28(2) and 28(3) are proceedings before grant because 28(4) tells us that the\\nrequest under the foregoing provisions that is 1, 2, 3 of the section shall be made before\\nthe grant of a patent ok.\\nSo, when we are talking about 28(7) proceeding for a certificate, it can be either before\\nor after the grant. Even the language of 28(7) tells us may at anytime apply to the\\ncontroller for a certificate anytime there is no time stipulation that it should be before the\\ngrant. So, even this provision read along with the rule which says patentees can be\\nnotified as the case may be tells us that the certificate or the rectification can be done\\neven after the grant. It can be done even after the grant before the controller then you\\nhave a second option if you want to rectify the register alone and you can go to the IPAB\\nthe IPAB may not rectify the specification.\\nSo, that’s a difference that we define here, here the controller may ask the specification\\nto be rectified and the register to be rectified whereas we saw in 71 it’s a procedure for\\nrectifying the register. Rule 69 procedure for hearing of claim or in application under\\nsection 28.\\n(Refer Slide Time: 24:29)\\n 530  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 533}), Document(page_content='The  procedure  specified  in  rules  55a  and  57  to  63  relating  to  filing  of  notice  of\\nopposition written statement reply statement, leaving evidence hearing and cost shall so\\nfar as may be applied to the hearing of a claim or an application under section 28 as a\\napply to opposition proceedings subject to modification, that reference to patentee shall\\nbe construed as the person making the claim or an application as the case may be. Now\\nthere is a general rule that we need to keep bear in mind, rule 55 A onwards or rule 55A\\nand rules 57 to 63 generally talk about the procedure in a post grant opposition, a post\\ngrant opposition as an opposition filed under section 25(2). So, post grant opposition is\\nthe ideal example of an contentious proceeding before the patent office it’s an ideal\\nexample.\\nBecause there are two parties both the parties are formally enter into the proceeding they\\nfile  their  evidences  the controller  hears  them and gives a decision there is also an\\nopposition board in those proceedings, but here both the parties have a remedy in appeal\\nand both the parties are heard by the controller. So, because post-grant opposition is an\\nideal template for conducting proceedings where two parties are involved before the\\ncontroller. The rules applicable for post grant proceedings are applicable even in another\\nproceeding where two parties may be involved. So, the same rules like rules as in how to\\nstart the proceeding by filing a form filing the statement by the opponent, then the\\npatentee files his reply then the opponent gets a chance to file a reply to the reply, then\\nthey will be a hearing then they will be evidence, the evidence will be closed if you want\\nto file evidence beyond that, then there is a procedure for that you have to seek special\\npermission then there will be a hearing and they can be an order on cause also.\\nSo, all the sequence that we saw on post grant opposition will apply not only for rule 69\\nthat is a proceeding under 28, but it will also apply for various other proceedings like\\nsurrender for instance compulsory licensing. So, understand that wherever there are two\\nparties one party being the patentee and the third party, any proceeding involving a\\npatentee and a third party or an applicant and a third party, the procedure to be followed\\nwill be the procedure for post grant opposition.\\nBut the procedure has not how do you adduce evidence who files first what is the time\\nframe for filing the reply what is the time frame for giving the reply to the reply, and\\nfixing the hearing, notice of hearing end of evidence at work beyond that how do you\\nadduce evidence all these formal procedures can be extrapolated can be changed or\\n 531  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 534}), Document(page_content='modified to apply for every proceedings. So, if its 28 proceeding you do not call that\\nperson in opponent you call the claimant and still the claimant will file a statement, the\\napplicant whoever wants to opposite will file their counter and the claimant will get\\nanother chance to make a statement based on certain issues, and there will be a hearing,\\nthey will be evident settle be given, there will be a hearing notice, there will be an order,\\nand there will be there can be a state of finding on costs.\\nSo,  this  provision  says  that  if  you  are  conducting  a  proceeding  under  28,  those\\nprocedures will apply who will start first, who will reply, what is the time line notice of\\nhearing all those 10 days notice so, that is what this means. You just saw that filing of\\nnotice of opposition written statement reply statement leaving evidence hearing cost all\\nthese things will be governed by those rules, but with small changes because there is no\\nnotice of opposition here, here it is a form 8.\\nSo, in that case it is form 7 that is forwarded along with the statement, here form 8 is\\nforwarded along with the statement. So, those changes now normally there is an hearing\\nin a post grant opposition the post grant opponent and the patentee are alone notice sent\\nonly for those two entities. In 28(7) notice could be sent to even interested people we\\nsaw that.\\nSo, we are only talking about hearing and notice of hearing, but to whom it is sent will\\nbe decided by the kind of proceeding, because in 28 notice can be sent to applicants\\nnotice can be sent to inventors, notice can also be sent to interested whom the controller\\nfeels is interested we saw that whereas, in post grant notice can only be sent to two\\nparties the post grant opponent and the patentee there is no third party. So, so these\\nmodification that word it is says subject to modification that reference to patentee shall\\nbe construed as a person making the claim or application as the case may be. \\nSo, those subject to modifications these provisions will apply, and rule 70 tells us the\\nform in which the mention has to be made. Any mention of an inventor under 28 (1) shall\\nbe made in the relevant documents that is complete specification and the register in the\\nfollowing form the inventor of this invention/substantial part of this invention within the\\nmeaning  of section  28 is  dash of dash.

The patents act provides for certain provisions of secrecy secrecy . And when\\nwe say secrecy secrecy  we specifically refer to the ability of an invention as disclosed in a\\ncomplete specification to be kept as a secret. In the contest of patent law when we see\\nkept as a secret, we always understand that as it’s opposite or we understand that by\\ncomparing with it’s opposite. Patent specifications are designed to be published and they\\nwould eventually at some point in time they will be published and will be available to the\\npublic.\\nNow in many case laws on proving lack of inventive step or obviousness, what matters\\nwith regard to the prior art was whether it was made available to the public. Publication\\nof an application or a granted patent makes the invention available to the public. The\\n 535  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 538}), Document(page_content='public can do many things with it can refer to it can work upon it as long as it does not\\ninfringe upon the rights granted under section 48. \\nThe public at large is allowed to look at the invention. A secrecy secrecy  provision when\\nthere  is  a  secrecy secrecy  direction  issued  under the  act.  The  invention  will  not be\\npublished, it will not be granted, rather it will be kept in a secret mode; in the sense that\\nit will be kept away from public scrutiny. Many countries have secrecy secrecy  provisions\\nand they are all tuned towards national security and for defense defence  purposes.\\nIf a country feels that certain inventions if they are published or if they are put into the\\npublic domain by publishing the application or by granting the patent, then they could be\\nin issue that could affect the security and the  defence defence  of the country. So, they\\nmany countries have similar provisions. So, sections 35 allows the controller if he is of\\nthe opinion that the invention is relevant for defense defence  purposes, then he may give\\ndirections prohibiting or restricting the publication of information about the invention.\\nSo, we already mentioned complete specifications are designed to be published. If you\\ndon’t publish a complete specification, if you don’t take a request for publication they\\nautomatically get published after 18 months. So, there is no way you can keep up a\\ncomplete specification a secret, because they are designed to publish to be published and\\nthe  fact  that  ones,  when  they  are  published  the  matter  disclosed  in  the  complete\\nspecification would fall for public access. The central government and the controller are\\nempowered to keep certain invention as secrets.\\nNow let us look at section 35. Section 35 states that were in respect of a application\\nmade  before  or  after  the  commencement  of  this  act  for  a  patent  it  appears  to  the\\ncontroller. So, what matters is the opinion of the controller. So, so we will get into details\\nas when the controller forms this opinion it appears to the controller that the invention is\\none of a class notified to him by the central government as relevant for defense defence\\npurposes. So, we understand that the controller forms as opinion which is based on a\\nnotification by the central government.\\nSo, the central government will make a notification on certain technologies or certain\\ninventions  being  relevant  for  defense defence  purposes.  Or  whether  otherwise  the\\ninvention appears to be appears to him to be so relevant. So, one if he it is one of the\\nnotified classes yes or even otherwise if it is not in the notified classes, but the controller\\n 536  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 539}), Document(page_content='forms an opinion that this could be meant for defense defence  purposes. For instants if\\nyou look at night vision, night vision is something which was initially which cameup as a\\ninvention  that  could  be  used  in  military  purposes  or  toady  there  are  various  other\\nequipments which have incorporated night vision.\\nSo, when the first time night vision would have been patented they may not be a clear\\nimplication on what could be the reach or what could be the impact of a such technology\\non  defense defence . So, the controller can either go by the notification issued by the\\ncentral government or the controller can form his own opinion. So, what is the controller\\ndo if he forms his opinion? He may give directions for prohibiting or restricting the\\npublication of a information with the respect to the invention or the communication of\\nsuch information.\\nNow  this  is  what  the  controller  can  do.  Controller  can  prohibit  the  publication  of\\ninformation with respect to the invention. So, he can prohibit the initial publication. So,\\nthe controller from this we understand that the controller has to form his opinion on the\\ninvention before it gets published. So, assume a case were an application is filed. Along\\nwith the application form 9 is filed. So, when form 9 is filed along with form 1 and 2 the\\napplication  should  get  published  immediately,  because  form  9  is  a  request  for\\npublication.\\nSo, assume a person files form 1 and 2 along with form 9 then the application will not\\nwait  for  the  18  month  period  it  may  get  published  immediately.  Where  does  the\\ncontroller form his opinion? Because this provision says the controller should form an\\nopinion and normally the controller will get to see an application after the application\\ncomes before him and he allots the application to an examiner. This is normally after the\\npublication after the 18 month period.\\nBut if an application comes along with form 9 which is a request for publication then the\\napplication will have to be published immediately, depending on the number of pending\\napplications if there is a que then according to the que, but the norm is when a request for\\npublication  is  taken  it  has  to be  published  immediately. Now  if  a  person  takes  an\\napplication form 1 along with form 9 when does the controller exercises discretion under\\nsection 35(1). Because assuming that there are on an average close to 50000 patent\\n 537  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 540}), Document(page_content='applications filed in India every year, the controller may have to go through and make a\\npreliminary opinion before there is a request for publication.\\nSo, we understand that if a request for publication is filed then the controller will have to\\nexercise some kind of a scrutiny, a quick scrutiny before it is published. Or if the 18\\nmonth period is available for it any time before the 18 month period because this call has\\nto be taken by the controller before the publication. So, the act is really not very clear as\\nto what time the controller will exercise this when will he form is opinion, but we can\\nunderstand that it as to be done for the secrecy secrecy  provision to be effective it has to\\nbe done before the publication.\\nNow let’s see how it works 35(2). Where the controller gives such directions as are\\nrefered to in subsection 1, he shall give notice of the application and of the directions to\\nthe central government.\\n(Refer Slide Time: 08:44)\\nAnd the central government shall upon receipt of notice consider whether the publication\\nof the invention would be prejudicial to the defense defence  of India. And if upon such\\nconsideration it appears to it that the publication of the invention would not so prejudice\\ngive notice to the controller to that effect who shall there upon revoke the directions and\\nnotified the applicant accordingly. Now this gives us one scenario, one scenario where\\nthe controller feels that something is relevant for the defense defence  purposes. He has to\\ngive notice to the central government. The controller first passes the direction saying that\\n 538  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 541}), Document(page_content='they shall not be any publication of the information, he passes that direction. Which\\nmeans the patent office will now not publish that patent application the invention or\\ndetails pertaining to the invention will not be published. Once he issues their act this is\\nsequence of events the controller looks in to the application he is of the opinion either by\\nconsidering the notification in issued by the central government the central government\\nis expected to give a notification, listing of the things that are relevant for or technologies\\nthat are relevant for defense defence  purposes. He may rely on the notification and say\\nsomething is relevant for defence defence  purposes or he may on his own opinion come\\nto a conclusion something is relevant.\\nWhen  the  controller  forms  his  opinion,  he  will  first  issue  a  direction  saying  that\\nsecrecy secrecy  direction is issued under 35(1), information should not be published.\\nOnce he does that once he issues a  secrecy secrecy  direction the next step will be to\\ncommunicate that by way of a notice to the central government, because the controller is\\nnot the person who can take a call on whether something is relevant for defense defence\\npurposes or not. He can at best make his preliminary opinion, based on his preliminary\\nopinion he can issue a direction not to publish and that is an internal affair with in his\\noffice.

The central government upon receipt of the notice\\nshall consider whether publication of the invention will prejudice, will be prejudicial to\\nthe defense defence  of India.\\nSo, the call on whether something will be prejudicial to the defense defence  of India has\\nto be taken by the central government and not by the controller. They may be some\\nconfusion  with  regard  to  who  takes  the  call  on  secrecy secrecy .  The  direction  of\\nsecrecy secrecy  is  issued  by  the  controller. The  controller  issues  the  secrecy secrecy\\ndirection, but the decision whether something is prejudicial to the  defense defence  of\\nIndia  that  decision  is  taken  by  the  central  government.  And  what  does  as  central\\ngovernment rely on? The central government relies on the application and the direction\\nissued by the controller. Once the central government comes  to the conclusion that\\npublication of this particular invention will not be prejudicial to the defense defence  of\\nIndia then the central government shall give notice.\\nThe first notice is given by the controller to the central government, now the central\\ngovernment shall give notice to the controller saying that this is not prejudicial. On\\n 539  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 542}), Document(page_content='receipt of the notice the controller shall revoke the direction which earlier issued and\\nnotify the  applicant  accordingly. When a  secrecy secrecy  direction  is  issued  nothing\\nhappens on an application. The application will not be published. There are provisions\\nwhere the prosecution can happen, but the application is not published. But once a\\nsecrecy secrecy  direction is revoked and that is revoked by the controller upon a notice\\nissued by the central government.\\nSo, there are 2 things the issuing of the direction secrecy secrecy  direction and revocation\\nof the  secrecy secrecy  direction is done by the controller. Issuing the  secrecy secrecy\\ndirection and revoking the  secrecy secrecy  direction is done by the controller, but the\\ndecision  on  whether  or  technology  or  an  invention  will  be  prejudicial  to  the\\ndefense defence  of India is a call that the central government has to take. 35(3), without\\nprejudice to the provisions contained in subsection 1 where is central government is of\\nthe opinion that the invention in respect of which the controller  has not given any\\ndirection under subsection 1 is relevant for defense defence  purposes it may at any time\\nbefore grant of a patent notify the controller to that effect and there upon the provisions\\nof sub section shall apply as if the invention were one of the class notified by the central\\ngovernment. And accordingly the controller shall give notice to the central government\\nof the directions issued by him.\\nNow, what happens in cases where the controller does not pick up an invention as being\\nrelevant for defense defence  purposes, there could be many reasons where the controller\\ndoes not pick it up. one by oversight the controller and the patent office could have\\nmissed it, two the list of notified things may not have this technology mentioned in it. So,\\nthere could be many reasons why the controller may things that something is not relevant\\nfor defense defence  purposes.\\nSo, in such cases if the central government founds an opinion that an invention is in\\nrespect of which the controller has not given any direction is relevant, at any time before\\nthe grant, it can notify the controller to that effect saying that this is relevant. And there\\nupon the provisions sub section shall apply as if the invention where one of the class\\nnotified by the central government. Now once the central government communicates to\\nthe controller that this technology though it is not notified is relevant for defense defence\\npurposes, then it will be as if it was a class notified by the central government.\\n 540  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 543}), Document(page_content='So, it the fact that the central government as communicated to the controller that a\\nparticular technology is relevant is enough it is as though it issued a notification saying\\nthat this is a class that is notified. And once that happens, the controller shall give notice\\nto the central government of the directions issued by him. Again the right to issue a\\nsecrecy secrecy  direction  is  only  with  the  controller.  You  can  see  that  the  central\\ngovernment will remind him that this technology is also relevant, but still the direction\\nhas to be issued by the controller.\\nThe reason for this is an invention which is covered by a patent. When it is filed before\\nthe patent office it is the controller who has a control over how the information is kept a\\nsecret or how it is to be published. This is not something which is the central government\\ndoes have many powers, central government even has the power to revoke, central\\ngovernment has the power to make rules and you can say that the controller is the\\nauthority under the central government. But the central government in itself cannot pass\\nthis direction because the act gives the controller to pass the direction.\\nSo, even when the when the central government informs the controller this particular\\ntechnology is relevant for defence defence  purposes, it has the effect of a notification as it\\nis as though the central government has notified this particular class also. And based on\\nnotification the controller will have to issue special secrecy secrecy  directions. So, that is\\nagain it has to be done by the controller.\\nSo, the controller will issue secrecy secrecy  directions once the government informs the\\ncontroller that something is relevant for defense defence  purposes, though it may not have\\nbeen in the class notified, there is we understand that there is a class of inventions and\\ntechnologies notified by the central government this particular technology was not there\\nin it, but still when the central government communicates to the controller the controller\\nshall issue notice of the directions.\\n 541  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 544}), Document(page_content='(Refer Slide Time: 17:05)\\nSo, he will have to issue directions  and inform the central  government. Now what\\nhappens to the secrecy secrecy  directions which have been issued by the controller? 36,\\nsecrecy secrecy  directions to be periodically reviewed; the question whether the invention\\nand respect  of which directions  have been given under section  35, continues  to be\\nrelevant  for  defense defence  purposes  shall  be  reconsidered  by  the  government  at\\nintervals  of 6 months  or on a request made by the applicant which is found to be\\nreasonable by the controller.\\nAnd if on such consideration it appears to the central government that the publication of\\nthe invention would no longer be prejudicial to the defence defence  of India or in the case\\nof an application filed by a foreign applicant it is found that the invention is published\\noutside India \\n 542  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 545}), Document(page_content='(Refer Slide Time: 17:44)\\nIt shall forthwith give notice to the controller to revoke the direction. And the controller\\nthereupon revoke the direction previously issued given by him and, 2) the result of every\\nreconsideration under subsection 1 shall be communicated to the applicant within such\\ntime in such manner as may be prescribed.\\nWe will have to look into the rules for that. So, what happens when a  secrecy secrecy\\ndirection is issued by the controller? The controller issues the secrecy secrecy  direction,\\nand we have already seen that though the controller issues the secrecy secrecy  direction,\\nhe only controls the transmission of information. He only protects the publication of\\ninformation. He does not take a call on whether a particular technology is relevant for\\ndefense defence  purposes because that is beyond the purview of the functions of the\\ncontroller. So, we know that it is the central government which would take a call on\\nwhether a particular technology is relevant for defense defence  purposes.\\nNow  once  the  central  government  takes  the  call,  section  36  allows  the  central\\ngovernment to it’s decision every 6 months. Because in 6 months so many things could\\nhave happened the technology could have come into the market. Or this technology\\ncould have been published in a journal or some information about it could have come out\\nfrom a third party, need not be through the applicant. So, if the information is already out\\nthen the there is no wisdom in keeping or maintaining the secrecy secrecy  direction. In\\nsuch cases the central government will ask the controller to revoke. Central government\\n 543  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 546}), Document(page_content='does not revoke it central government will now say that this technology for which we\\npassed the secrecy secrecy  direction is now available for everyone it is no longer a secret.\\nSo, revoke the secrecy secrecy  direction. So, the only way you can request or the central\\ngovernment or the controller  can revoke a  secrecy secrecy  direction  is the invention\\nceases  to be a secret.  So, if you  are asked what are the conditions  under which a\\nsecrecy secrecy  direction  issued  by  the  controller  can  be  revoked.  The  fundamental\\ncondition is that what was earlier kept a secret is now no longer a secret. It is not a secret\\nin India or it was disclosed outside they could be n number of reasons you need not have\\ndisclose to the world third party could have disclosed. And it is now on the public\\ndomain the fact of the invention is in the power of public domain enough to revoke a\\nsecrecy secrecy  direction. \\nNow So, this the central government will have to review every 6 months because there\\nwill be new  disclosures  coming  new  technologies  new  products  coming  the central\\ngovernment  will  have  to  look  reconsiderate  every  6  months  to  see  whether  the\\nsecrecy secrecy  directions that have been issued are valid. Alternatively the applicant can\\nmake a request. Now when the applicant makes a request to the controller and the\\ncontroller finds that request to be reasonable and if on the consideration the central\\ngovernment reconsiders it, and feels that it need not be kept a secret then it will asked the\\ncontroller to revoke the direction.\\nSo, either the central government can do on it is own every 6 months or the applicant can\\nasked  the  controller  to reconsider  it.  There  are  2  ways  to  revoke  a  secrecy secrecy\\ndirection. Now if the central government comes to a conclusion that the invention would\\nno longer be prejudicial to the defense defence  of India could be that the technology has\\nchanged  or something  else has  happened which is much  more  relevant, the  central\\ngovernment can say that revoke the secrecy secrecy  direction.\\nThe other case is that, if the application filed by a foreign applicant is found it is found\\nthat the invention is published outside India. Then again the controller shall be asked to\\nrevoke the direction. Now if there is in  defense defence  related technology filed by a\\nforeign applicant in India. Most likely the foreign applicant would have filed applications\\nin his home country. Now if those applications get published assume that those country\\ndid  not  grant  a  secrecy secrecy  direction,  then  there  is  no  point  in  keeping  a\\n 544  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 547}), Document(page_content='secrecy secrecy  direction on the Indian application, because it is already published same\\napplication.\\nSo,  the  corresponding  foreign  application  got  published  so,  there  is  no  point.  If  a\\npublication happens, and if the secret is no longer a secret that is the ground for revoking\\nthe direction; so you revoke a  secrecy secrecy  direction if a secret does not remain a\\nsecret or if the central government is of the opinion that the technology or the invention\\ncovered is no longer relevant or no longer prejudicial to the defense defence  of India. So,\\nthese are the 2 conditions. Now once the central government re considers it shall be the\\ndecision shall be communicated to the applicant.\\n(Refer Slide Time: 23:18)\\nNow let’s look at the consequences of the secrecy secrecy  direction. What happens when\\na secrecy secrecy  direction has issued? Now when a secrecy secrecy  direction is issued by\\nthe controller, the controller shall not pass an order refusing to grant the same. He cannot\\nrefuse the application while an order is pending. So, as long as there is a secrecy secrecy\\ndirection in force the application cannot be refused and no appeal shall lie from any order\\nof the controller passed in respect thereof.\\nNow, if the controller passes a secrecy secrecy  direction, then there cannot be an appeal in\\nrespect of such a direction as long as the secrecy secrecy  direction is in force. Now we are\\nalready mentioned the provisions of appeal are contained in section 117 (a) of the patents\\nact; instances where an appeal lies to the intellectual property appellate board. So (35),\\n 545  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 548}), Document(page_content='(36), (37) which we have been seeing, an order issued by the controller cannot be\\nappealed; they are not grounds on which an appeal can be file before the intellectual\\nproperty appellate board. So, the subsection continues provided that the application may\\nsubject to directions proceed up to the stage of a grant of a patent, but the application and\\nspecification found to be in order for grant of the patent shall not be published and no\\npatent shall be granted in pursuance of that application.\\nSo, even if there is a secrecy secrecy  direction the patent office can continue the process\\nof prosecution, and it can make it ready up until the grant of a patent, but it cannot grant\\nthe patent. So, everything else short of grant can happen everything else short of reject\\ncan also happened. So, this  secrecy secrecy  provision affects  the outside world. The\\nprosecution of the patent is not stopped by a secrecy secrecy  provision.\\nSo, if there is an FER issued the applicant can respond to the FER, if there are further\\nobjections issued by the patent office the applicant can do that respond to them if the\\npatent office insist on an amendment the applicant can amend the patent, they can do any\\nnumber of things, but for either grant of the patent or reject of the patent, these 2 things\\ncannot happened. The patent office cannot grant or reject short of that they can do\\neverything else. So, and we are talking about internal procedures within the patent office.\\n(Refer Slide Time: 26:16)\\n37 (2) where a complete specification filed in pursuance of an application for a patent for\\nan invention in respect of which directions have been given under section 35 is found to\\n 546  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 549}), Document(page_content='be in order for a grant during the continuation in force of the directions then if during the\\ncontinuation in force of the directions any use of the invention is made by or on behalf or\\nto the order of the government under sections 100, 101 and 103 shall apply in relation to\\nthat use as if the patent had been granted for that invention.\\nAnd if it appears to the central government that the applicant for the patent has suffered\\nhardship  by  reason  of  the  continuation  of  in  force  of  the  directions,  the  central\\ngovernment may make to him such payment if any by way of a solatium as appears to\\nthe central government to be reasonable having regard to the novelty and utility of the\\ninvention  and  the  purpose  for  which  it  is  designed  and  to  any  other  relevant\\ncircumstances. Now this sub section tells us if a secrecy secrecy  direction is given under\\nsection 35 and the patent is found to be in order for a grant.\\nSo, it is got over all the all the objections in prosecution and it is found to be in order for\\na grant, if during the continuation of the  secrecy secrecy  direction there is use of the\\ninvention by the government. And we know that the government can use or even acquire\\nthe invention, like how the government can acquired private property reliant acquisition\\nact allows the government to acquire private property, that government can also acquire\\nintellectual property or use intellectual property and the provisions from section 100, 101\\nand 103 pertained to that.\\nNow, if the government uses the invention then it will be as though it used it under\\nsection 100, 101 and 103 as if the patent has been granted.

There are provisions for that\\nor  if  the  government  acquires  the  patent  then  the  government  can  give  some\\ncompensation. Now 100, 101, 103 all pertain to applications that have already been\\nmaterialize into a grant. Section 100 on words applies to cases where there is already a\\ngrant and government wants to use that invention, then  the  government  uses  that\\ninvention it gives royalty or some kind of compensation.\\nNow, in this case when a  secrecy secrecy  direction is issued we had already seen that\\nthere cannot be a grant, because pending secrecy secrecy  direction the patent cannot be\\ngranted.

So, this is a deeming provision which allows the applicant to have\\ncertain rights of a patentee even before the grant. The reason being the grant the only\\nissue  that  hinders  the  grant  is  the  secrecy secrecy  direction,  had  there  not  been  a\\nsecrecy secrecy  direction it would have been granted.

(3), where a patent is granted in pursuance of an\\napplication in respect of which directions have been issued under section 35, no renewal\\nfee shall be payable in respect of any period during which those directions were in force.\\nSo, the rey could be a question that what are the instances in which an applicant or a\\npatentee whose patent has been granted is not bound to pay renewal fee during the life of\\na patent. The renewal fee is collected after the grant because i fs the patent office is going\\nto reject the patent term starts from the date of filing the application.

Because it is always like that the renewal fee cannot\\nbe paid as the time of application because you do not whether you will get a grant or not.\\nSo, innovatively in all the cases the renewal fee is back dated or you paid for upon grant\\nyou paid for all the years, you have been those years the application was still in the in\\nthea  state in which it was not a formal grant, but still your term covers the time you\\nspent in the application state.\\n 549  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 552}), Document(page_content='So, if you spent 5 years in the application s state in the patent office still you will have to\\npay the fees for all those 5 years after the grant.

This\\nprovision allows the controller to extend the time for doing something because there was\\nthe  secrecy secrecy  direction  in  force.

Now  72 ( 1) states  that  the  result  of  every\\nreconsideration under subsection 1 of 36 shall be communicated to the applicant for\\npatent within 15 days of the receipt of the notice by the controller. So, if the controller\\nreceives notice from central government after reconsideration it shall may communicated\\nto the applicant within 15 days.\\n2) states that extension of time on revocation secrecy secrecy  directions under section 38.\\nNow this actually covers section 38. Now 72 mentions  36(2); 36 2 , 72 (2) refers to\\nsection 38 which is revocation of  secrecy secrecy  direction and extension of time. The\\nextension of time to be given for doing anything required or authorized to be done under\\nsection 38 shall not exceed the period for which the directions given by the central\\ngovernment  under  section  35(1);  35  1  were  in  force.  Now  if  the  secrecy secrecy\\ndirections were in force for say 12 months. Now the extension of time for doing anything\\nunder the act under section 38 shall not exceed 12 months.\\nSo, this only gives the applicant a time equivalent to the time where he could not do\\nanything. The secrecy secrecy  direction was for 12 months he was not able to do things\\nfor 12 months he will be given an extension of another 12 months to do whatever you\\nwants to. If the  secrecy secrecy  direction was only for 6 months then the extension of\\ntime should also be only for 6 months. So, this provision just says that the extension of\\ntime will not exceed the period of for which the directions w here issued and were in\\nforce.\\n 552  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 555}), Document(page_content='(Refer Slide Time: 39:15)\\nNow, let  us’s look at section 39. Section 39 is slightly deferent different in it is operation\\nbecause all these file 36, 37, 35, 36, 37, 38 were specific cases were there was an\\ninvention , an application for which was filed before the patent office and the controller\\nfelt  that  this  could  be  relevant  for  defen sce  purposes  and  you  he  should  issued  a\\nsecrecy secrecy  direction.\\nOnce the direction is issued the central government will have to look at it either uphold\\nthe secrecy secrecy  direction or ask  ited to be revoked. And the central government also\\nhas the power to intimate the controller separately whether the controller looks at the\\nclass of notified inventions and technologies whether he does that or not the controller\\nthe central government has the power to initiate things on it ’ is own.  (39) pertains to\\napplication for patents outside India. (39) residence not to apply for patents outside India\\nwithout prior permission. Authority 9 only 39 affects people, who are resident in India .\\n39(1) , one  states no person resident in India shall except under authority of a written\\npermit sought in the manner prescribed and granted by or on behalf of the controller.\\nMake or cause to be made an application outside India for the grant of a patent for an\\ninvention.\\nSo, a person whose resident in India cannot make an application outside India for the\\ninvention that was made in India without a written permission of the controller unless, a\\nthe application for a patent of the same invention has been made in India not less than 6\\n 553  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 556}), Document(page_content='weeks before the application outside India. So, you need not seek permission you need\\nnot seek the permit. If you had made the application first in India, then there is no need\\nfor seeking permission, if an application was made not less than 6 weeks before the\\napplication outside India. So, 6 week before the foreign application was made that is the\\napplication outside India an application was made in India which means you file first in\\nIndia. If a resident files first in India there was no need for him to take permission under\\nsection 39.\\nAnd either no direction has been given under subsection 1 of 35 in relation to the\\napplication  India  or  all  such  directions  have  been  revoked.  Now  this  brings  an d\\ninteresting aspect into how the patent office works. Now, one we say that if a person\\nwhose resident in India has to file an application for a patent he has to file it in India\\nfirst. If you he wants to filed first outside India he needs to take a permission.\\nSo, in an ideal case he will file the application in India after 6 weeks he will file it in any\\nforeign country where he wants. But if an application is not filed in India then he will\\nhave to take permission. Now the permission is not required if no direction is passed\\nunder section 35 1 or if a direction was passed and it was revoked. To simplify this, let us\\nfirst look at the instances where a person resident in India need not take permission. Let\\nus look at the then we look at the instances where hHe needs to take permission.\\nHe need not take permission if he makes the application first in India. And after 6 weeks\\nhe files an application outside India, no permission require d. And he files an application\\nin India and there is no direction issued under 35 ( 1), no secrecy secrecy  direction issued\\nor secrecy secrecy  direction was issued and it was revoked. Now this tells us that there is\\na 6 week window period which you have to wait for filing a foreign application. If you\\nfile an application in India and if you want to file a foreign application you will have to\\nwait for 6 weeks, and we can assume within that 6 weeks the controller will quickly look\\ninto the application and see whether it is relevant for defen sce purposes and he may issue\\nin secrecy secrecy  direction under section 35.\\nSo, the 6 week window period is allowed for the controller to look into the application\\nand see whether it is relevant for defen sce purposes, because within that 6 weeks if he\\npasses the  secrecy secrecy  direction then you cannot file an application outside India.\\nBecause the condition for filing an application outside India as is one you should file it in\\n 554  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 557}), Document(page_content='India first and wait for 6 weeks to file it outside India and no secrecy secrecy  direction\\nshould be passed, if you have invented something in India and if you are a resident then\\nin a normal case if you want to file an application outside India you will wait for 6 weeks\\nand then file the application.\\nNow if you want to file first in a foreign country, then you will need to take the foreign\\nfiling license or the permit. The acts is says  written permit you have to seek a written\\npermit from the controller, there is a form for it you can see the cross reference form 25\\nis  the  relevant  form:  39 ( 2) states  that,  the  controller  shall  dispose  of  every  such\\napplication within such period as may be prescribe d.\\nAn application  that is  been made  seeking a written permit  shall be disposed of as\\nprescribed provided that if the invention is relevant for defen sce purpose or atomic\\nenergy the controller shall not grant permit without the prior consent of the central\\ngovernment. So, apart from defen sce now we also have atomic energy coming in. But\\nfrom section 4 we know that patent covering atomic energy under section 20 of the\\natomic energy act shall not be granted; 39 ( 3) states that this section shall not apply in\\nrelation  to an invention  for which an application for protection  has been filed in a\\ncountry outside India by a person resident outside India.\\nSo, this will not apply for non residence. If a person is not a resident in India then he can\\nfile it without seeking the permission in the country where he wants to most likely the\\ncountry where he is a resident. So, from this we understand that there are if a resident has\\nto file d an application first in a foreign country he has to seek permission. But if he\\nwants to file in India and then file in a foreign country the permission is not required he\\njust needs to wait for 6 weeks and then file it provided there is no secre ccy direction.

If there are three co-owners, a cannot license the patent or share either the entire\\npatent or a share in a patent, he cannot assign the share in a patent except with the\\nconsent of the other two co-owners b and c.\\nNow, this is because exploiting a patent would mean that all the three co-owners should\\nbe equally benefited if there is no agreement to the contrary. If there is an agreement\\nsaying that b and c will not want any remuneration or any benefit from the patent, and a\\nis given a sole authority to monetize it, then a will be allowed to deal with third parties\\nwithout the consent of b and c.

So, if a acts as an owner of a patent and the purchaser\\ndoes not deal with b and c, it will be as if a, b, and c had together sold the property to or\\nthe patented article to the purchaser. Now this incorporates the principle of agency if\\nthere are three owners; if one owner represents the one owner can act as an agent for the\\nother two owners.\\nSo, any person who deals with that one person it will be as though he had dealt with all\\nthe other three.

Section 51 gives the\\ncontroller certain powers to give directions to co-owners. Section 51 states that section\\n51(1) states that where two or more persons are registered as grantee or proprietor of a\\npatent, the controller may upon application made to him in the prescribed manner any of\\nthose persons, give such directions in accordance with the application as to the sale or\\nlease of the patent or any interest therein.

Now these directions\\ncan be with regard to sale or lease of a patent or any interest therein, the grant of licenses\\nunder patent or exercise of any right under section 50. Now the controller has power to\\nissue directions with regard to co-owners. To issue such a direction one of the co-owners\\nwill have to make an application before the controller. The co-owners may make an\\napplication though relevance forms as form 11 and request the controller to issue a\\ndirection. Now they could be many instances where the one of the co-owners may\\napproach the controller. For instance of the three co-owners the example which we were\\ndiscussing before a, b, and c.\\nA wants to license his patent to a third party, b and c do not give consent for such a\\nlicense. A can take a form 11 and request the controller to issue directions because the\\ncontroller has power to issue directions with regard to sale, with regard to lease of a\\npatent, any interest therein, the grant of licenses under the patent or exercise of any of the\\nrights under section 50.

So, to do by any of the other\\nperson so registered, the controller may upon application made to him in the prescribed\\nmanner, give directions empowering any person to execute that instrument or to do that\\nthing in the name or on behalf of the person and default. Now this gives another scenario\\nif a, b, and c are the co-owners and a wants to license the invention to a third party, a can\\nsend a copy of the license indeed to b and c.\\n51(2) envisages the situation where the controller has issued a direction. As we saw in\\nthe earlier example of the three co-owners a, b, and c. A has approached the controller for\\na direction to grant a license under the patent, and b and c are not co-operating. Now\\nonce the direction is issued, a can send the instrument the license deed to b and c, asking\\nthem to execute it and giving them 14 days time.

The appellate board or court may by order passed\\nin the same proceeding permit the grand to the petitioner of the whole or such part of the\\ninvention which appellate board or could find has been wrongly obtained by the patentee\\nin lieu of the patent so revoked or excluded by amendment.\\nSo, this provision is the same as 26. In 26 we saw that if the whole patent is wrongfully\\nobtained then the whole patent could be granted in the name of the opponent. In this case\\nagain if the whole patent is granted instead of revoking the patent the appellate board or\\nthe court can substitute the petitioner that is the person from whom the patent was\\nwrongfully obtained as the owner of the patent.\\nNow, in cases where it is not the whole patent that is wrongfully obtained, but only a\\nclaim then the appellate board or the court can ask for the exclusion of those claims by\\namendment  and  grant  those  claims  to  the  petitioner  what  has  been  excluded  by\\namendment. So, there are 2 cases here, the first cases where the entire invention is\\nwrongfully obtained then the entire invention can be instead of revoking the invention\\nthe appellate board or the court and when we see court here it means the court were a\\n 590  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 593}), Document(page_content='claim for revocation is made and we will see that a claim for revocation of a patent or\\ninvalidation of a patent can be made in an infringement suit as a counter claim.\\nSo, revocation under section 64 can happen either before the appellate board or before a\\ncourt which is deciding the infringement case. So, revocation can be taken as a defense\\nfor infringement. So, the 2 consequences if the patent is revoked by the appellate board\\nor the court on the ground that it was wrongly obtained if the entire invention is said to\\nhave been wrongly obtained then the petitioner will be now shown as the owner of the\\ninvention the appellate board or the court can permit the grant to the petitioner of the\\nwhole  or  such  part  of  the  invention  which  means  if  the  whole  invention  is  been\\nwrongfully obtained the petitioner will become the owner of the whole invention he will\\nbe now made the owner.\\nIf only a part of the invention was wrongfully obtained then the appellate board or the\\ncourt will order amendment  of that patent  remove  the  claims  that  were wrongfully\\nobtained and grant then to the petitioner. 52(2) where such order passed, the controller\\nshall on request by the petitioner made in a prescribed manner grant him one in cases\\nwhere appellate board or court permit the whole of the patent to be granted in new patent\\nwhere in the same date and number as the patent revoked. 2 in cases where the appellate\\nboard or court permits only part of the patent to be granted a new patent for such part\\nbearing  the  same  date  as  the  patent  revoke  a  number  in  such  manner  as  may  be\\nprescribed.\\nNow, for this to happen the petitioner has to make a request under form 12 to the\\ncontroller. So, 52(1) talks about an order passed by the appellate board or the court the\\nappellate board or the court in a proceeding where revocation was considered instead of\\nrevoking the patent grants the patent to the petitioner the entire patent to the petitioner or\\na part of a few claims to the petitioner, now with that order the petitioner will have to\\napproach the controller because the controller is a person who maintains the register of\\npatents and the register of patent has to be corrected for the record to be set straight.\\nSo, even if the appellate board or the court passes an order in favor of the petitioner the\\npetitioner will still have to approach the controller to correct the record now that is done\\nby form 12. Now the question arise form 12 is filed pursuant to a b c and d choices\\npursuant to a preceding under section 25 2 proceeding under section 64 the proceeding\\n 591  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 594}), Document(page_content='under  section  25  1  none  of  the  above.  So,  form  12  is  always  filed  pursuant  to  a\\nrevocation under section 64.\\nSo, you cannot file form 12 unless the patent has already been revoked and we are not\\ntalking about revocation by the controller, but we are talking about revocation by the\\nappellate board or by the court. So, in cases where the whole patent is granted to the\\npetitioner, a new patent will be issued to the petitioner bearing the same date and number\\nas the patent revoked. The patent revoked the number will remain the same the date will\\nremain the same, but the name will be of the petitioner the name will be substituted. So,\\nthis a new patent will be granted, but in the name of the petitioner.\\nSame number same date, but the petitioners name will be different this is where the\\nentire patent is entire invention is obtained. In cases where the appellate board or the\\ncourt permits only part of the patent to be granted meaning which few claims which way\\nwrongfully obtained to be granted, a new patent for such part bearing the same date as\\nthe patent revoked and numbered in such manner as may be prescribed. So, in this case\\nthe date will be the same, but the number will be different the name of the patentee will\\nalso be different.\\nNow, you can see this as a or a similar analogy to what is happening in this provision\\nwill be instances where the patent office can divide an application. Under section 16 the\\npatent office can divide an application separate the claims into 2 different applications\\ngrant them with different number they will have different numbers, they will have the\\nsame  date but different number  here because they were claims  that were taken the\\ncontroller will have to do a similar exercise of dividing the application, but in this case\\nthe owners will also be different.\\nIn a divisional application the owner will be the same because there was more than one\\ninvention  the  controller  will  have  to  separate  it here again  there  is  more  than  one\\ninvention in the sense that invention belonging to different people in section 16 there was\\nmore than one invention, because there we were talking about invention has been one\\ninvention the rule is one invention per application the applicant included 2 inventions in\\nan application because there was more than one invention the controller divided it.\\nThis we don’t call it a divisional, because the divisional and the parent belongs to the\\nsame person here the divisional, but this is a kind of dividing the claims are taken off and\\n 592  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 595}), Document(page_content='granted a patent you cannot grant a patent it just a claims the descriptive part should also\\nbe there.

Now if the controller is going to grant\\nonly the claim in the name of the petitioner then the petitioner can have to file a new and\\ncomplete specification to the satisfaction of the controller describing and claiming the\\npart of the invention for which the patent is granted.

The claim will be taken from the earlier part the descriptive part we can assume\\nthat there will be some kind of a overlap. The destructive part cannot be taken from the\\nearlier application because earlier application belongs to another person.

So, the petitioner soon after\\nrevocation was not the patentee he became the patentee only after filing form 12 and the\\npatent office asking him to file a complete specification with the claims and that resulting\\nin a grant.\\nSo, in this case understand that there are 2 grants subsection 3 says that no suits shall be\\nbrought for any infringement of a patent granted under the section committed before the\\nactual date on which such patent was granted.

So, surrender is a voluntary act by which the patentee gives up his right in a\\npatent.

Now let us look at section 63 surrender of patents , (1) a patentee\\nmay at any time give notice on the prescribed manner to the controller offer to surrender\\nhis patent.\\nSo, it is in by notice a patentee can offer to surrender his patent. Now one such an offer is\\nmain the controller shall publish offer in a prescribed manner and notify every person\\nwhose name appears in the register. Now if there are multiple owners to the patent if\\nthere are more than one patentee in the register of patents, then if one person chooses to\\nsurrender the patent the controller has to give notice to the other parties. So, that the\\ncontroller can take care of their interest there is also an opposition proceeding because\\nsurrender of a patent could involve rights of third parties it could affect the rights of\\nothers.\\nSo, there is any person interested can give notice to the controller of opposition, and as\\nwe have already stated the procedure for conducting any opposition under the patents act\\ninvolved two parties, will be the same as the procedure for post grant opposition. Section\\n55(a) onwards the same procedure will be followed for any opposition under the patents\\nact involved in two parties. So, there is a provision for opposing the surrender of patents,\\nand if the controller is satisfied after hearing the patentee and the opponent the patent\\nmay properly be surrendered he may accept the offer and by order revoke the patent.\\nNow, this is important to understand, surrender is an act from the patentee to give up his\\nor her patent.

Surrender in itself does not revoke a patent, it is important to understand\\nthat because 63(4) tells us that the offer to surrender has to be accepted by the controller\\nand by order the controller has to revoke the patent.

Revocation of patents\\ncan  be  understood  in  the  context  of  opposition  of  patents,  because  opposition  is  a\\nproceeding similar to revocation, but the proceeding happens at the patent office and we\\nsaw that there are two types of oppositions. The opposition could be to an application\\nwhat we call a patent application. That is opposed before it’s grant and it is also called\\npre-grant opposition or the opposition could be one year after the grant what is known as\\nthe opposition after the grant or the post-grant opposition. Now, these two types of\\nopposition are proceedings by which you can challenge the validity of the patent before\\nthe patent office.\\nRevocation are proceedings or revocation proceedings are proceedings either before the\\nIntellectual Property Appellate Board, what is called the Appellate Board or the High\\n 614  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 617}), Document(page_content='Court which has taken cognizance of an infringement proceeding. There is a pending\\ninfringement  suit.  In  that  proceeding,  the  high  court  can  entertain  a  revocation\\nproceeding. So, revocation of patents can either happen before the appellate board or in\\nthe high court. They are similar to opposition proceedings because some of the grounds\\ndo overlap grounds of opposition and the grounds of revocation do overlap. They are\\nsimilar because these grounds could be used to challenge the validity of a patent. So, the\\ncommon theme for opposition as well as the revocation that is section 25 and section 64\\nis the fact that these proceedings can be used to check the validity of a patent or you\\ncould even called them broadly as invalidation proceedings.\\nSo,  invalidation  proceedings  which  includes  opposition  and  revocation  fall  into\\nacategory  of  proceedings  where  you  can  invalidate  a  granted  patent.  Infringement\\nproceedings, this is the other aspect of patents infringement proceedings which are taken\\nto enforce the patent. So, infringement proceedings are taken by the patentee or a person\\nwho is an exclusive licensee who is interested in enforcing the patent. So, infringement\\nproceedings are you can look at infringement proceedings and invalidation proceedings\\nas two sides of the same coin, the coin being the patent. Infringement proceedings are\\nused to enforce the patent to make people pay license fee on the patent to stop people\\nfrom doing certain things covered by the patent. All these proceedings are what we call\\ninfringement proceedings you want to enforce your right. On the other side of the coin,\\nyou  have invalidation  proceedings  which  comprises  of as  we mentioned  opposition\\nproceedings and revocation proceedings now invalidation proceedings are proceedings\\nby which you can question the validity of a patent.\\nSo, on one side the patentee would like to enforce the patent and on the other side, when\\na patent is being enforced, you can question the patent by saying that this right should\\nnot be enforced because this right was improperly granted. There is no valid right in the\\nfirst place. For instance, a person can raise a issue that this patent lacks inventive step.\\nThere  is  no  inventive  step.  So,  it  was  granted  by  the  patent  office,  but  I  am  not\\nquestioning the inventive step or a person may say that this patent does not have novelty,\\nit  does  not  satisfy  the  requirements  of  novelty.  So,  in  all  these  grounds,  what  is\\nessentially being done is the validity of the patent is being questioned, validity of a\\ngranted patent. So, you will see in 64 that many grounds of 64 overlap over the grounds\\nof 25. So, we understand 25 and 64 together following forming a group or a set of\\n 615  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 618}), Document(page_content='proceedings what we together call invalidation proceedings or validity of a patent is\\nchecked.\\nSo, the grounds of revocation are much more expensive than the grounds of opposition.\\nSo, you will find that if you compare the grounds of opposition and the grounds of\\nrevocation, the grounds are more expensive. Historically there are some reasons why the\\ngrounds are more expensive because earlier before the intellectual property was created,\\nthe high court were the only courts that were vested with the power to revoke a patent.\\nThe high court where the only courts or the only forum where you could challenge the\\nvalidity of a patent. So, because the high courts could get into the matter in the form of a\\nlegal dispute, they could adduce expert evidence, they could appoint scientific advisors\\nand you could have trial examination, cross examination because the legal procedure\\nprovided  them  to  get  into  great  detail  about  the  invention  and  the  surrounding\\ncircumstances.  One  explanation  is  that  the  grounds  for  revocation  are  much  more\\nexpensive than the grounds of opposition. Opposition happens at the patent office. The\\ncontroller who sits in the position though he has the powers of the civil court, but the\\ncontroller  may  not  exercise  all  the  powers  of  a  civil  court  because  of  certain\\nadministrative reasons and we have not known of any of the decisions from the patent\\ncontroller, where the patent controller has subjected a party to cross examination or\\nwhere the party was cross examined in front of the controller. We have not seen any\\ndecision, but this is just to tell you that the expertise of these two bodies are different.\\nThe controller who mans the patent office and the high court which is staffed by judicial\\nmembers and you will see one of the reasons for challenging a patent is on the ground of\\nfraud, amendment that is carried out by fraud. You will just see it here. Yeah we have it\\nhere.\\n 616  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 619}), Document(page_content='(Refer Slide Time: 06:24)\\nO) the leave to amend the complete specification under section 57 of 58 was obtained by\\nfraud. Now, this is not a ground of opposition. In 25, if you see fraud cannot be pleaded\\nas a ground for a opposition. Again the reason lies because of the expertise of the\\norganization, the high court and originally 64 was a power which was exclusively with\\nhigh court. After the intellectual property appellate board was created, that power part of\\nthat power was also transferred to the intellectual property appellate board. In any case\\nthe chairman of the intellectual property appellate board by law has to be a person who\\nhas been a retired high court judge. So, we could find that you would still be able to\\napply these proving fraud is difficult and there are procedures to be followed. A fraud is\\nto be proved, fraud has to be specifically pleaded and there has to be the burden of\\ndischarging proof of fraud is much higher than it is in any other case because fraud goes\\nto the conduct of a person whereas, all the other aspects we are just looking at documents\\nand comparing state of the art with the invention whether there is been inventive step.\\nThis goes to the conduct of a person. The body that decides or that adjudicates on a fraud\\nhas to be sufficiently equipped to look into this ground. So, that’s one explanation as to\\nwhy we have more grounds of revocation than we have grounds of opposition. \\nNow, let us look at section 64. The host of grounds, we will just quickly take you\\nthrough. Now, the 64 tells us that a patent that is been granted under the act, so 64\\napplies only for granted patents, can be revoked on a petition of any person interested or\\nof the central government.\\n 617  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 620}), Document(page_content='So, there are two categories of people who can approach with the revocation petition. It\\ncan be a person interested by a person interested. We mean a person who is defined as a\\nperson interested under the act and who has some interest in the technology or in the area\\nof the invention or of the central government itself this specific provision by which the\\ncentral government can revoke a patent. So, the central government is also included\\nwhen there are issues concerning national interest and security, the central government\\ncan revoke a patent. So, any interested person or the central government can by a petition\\n,request for the revocation of a patent and the request for revocation can happen in two\\nplaces. Either they can request the patent to be revoked by the appellate board, that’s\\ninstance number 1. By the appellate board, you have to file a revocation of a patent and\\nnow  we  have  appellate  board  rules.  We  have  two  sets  of  appellate  board  rules.\\nIntellectual property appellate board rules for patents and there are different forms, there\\nare different proceedings for that and all that is detailed in the rules.\\nSo, 1) you can request a revocation of a patent by a petition to the appellate board that is\\nwhat we call an original preceding, though appellate board that the name of the body is\\nthe appellate board, the appellate board also has certain original powers or original\\njurisdiction. The appellate  power of a body is to decide  appeals. To put it a plain\\nlanguage, there are decisions from another body, a subordinate body, the patent office, all\\nthe  central  government  matters  in  appeal  are  decided  by  the  intellectual  property\\nappellate board. So, the appellate board gets his name because it sits in appeal over\\nsubordinate  body  that  is  largely  the  patent  office  and  in  some  cases,  the  central\\ngovernment, the appellate board also has original powers. When we say original power,\\nwe refer to the fact that they need not be in earlier order passed by and subordinate body\\nto be taken up in appeal. You can directly approach the intellectual property appellate\\nboard for certain reliefs.\\nSo, when you directly approach not by way of an appeal, appeal is the controller as\\npassed in order under section 15, you are aggrieved as a applicant. You want to appeal.\\nThat is again there is an order which you challenge. So, that is why we call it an appeal\\nor the control of passes an order under section 25(4) revoking your patent pursuant to a\\npost grant opposition, again there is an order. You take the order in appeal. Now, all these\\nproceedings are appellate proceedings or proceedings where the body that decides the\\nappellate board decides using its appellate jurisdiction or its jurisdiction or its power to\\n 618  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 621}), Document(page_content='decide appeals. The intellectual property appellate board also has a direct power to take a\\npetition from a person which is not in the form of an appeal. So, revocation is one such\\npetition where the appellate board can directly take a matter even in the absence of an\\norder by an subordinate body.\\nSo, revocation is one such preceding where the appellate board can exercise its original\\njurisdictions  and  when  we  say  original  jurisdiction,  we  refer  to  the  fact  that  an\\napplication can directly be filed to the appellate board for a relief rather than agitating an\\nearlier order by a subordinate body like the patent controller for an appellate relief.\\nSo, revocation can be by a petition to the appellate board or counterclaim in a suit for\\ninfringement of a patent by the high court. Now, this is a second category where you can\\nraise the revocation of a patent under the grounds mentioned in section 64 as an issue.\\nNow, the second place where you can raise revocation in grounds is a counterclaim in a\\nsuit for infringement. So, counterclaim we understand that as a claim against another\\nclaim in a suit for infringement of a patent. Suit for an infringement of a patent is a\\nproceeding  where  the  patentee  files  a  suit  to  enforce  his  patents.  We had  already\\nmentioned a patent is like a coin and there are two sides of the coin. On one side, the\\npatent  can  be  enforced  through  certain  proceedings  what  we  call  infringement\\nproceedings and on the other side, the patents validity can be questioned by third parties\\nwhat we call invalidity proceedings.\\nSo, a revocation  is  a kind of invalidity proceeding.  So, when patentee  has  already\\nenforced his right or the patentee has already approached to the court to enforce a patent,\\nin that case or in that suit, a third party or the infringer against from the cases filed can\\nraise a counterclaim. Now, counterclaim is a claim for another claim or a claim against a\\nclaim. So, the claim in an infringement suit is that the infringer is infringing the patent.\\nThe counter claim would be that let it be that the infringer has infringing, but the patent\\nis invalid.\\nSo, how can they be infringement of an invalid patent? So, that is the counter claim. Can\\nthey be infringement of an invalid patent, can an invalid patent be used to stop a person\\nfrom doing things or for claiming damages? So, this is a counterclaim. When somebody\\ntries to enforce a patent against you, you challenge the validity of a patent saying that\\nyou have no right to enforce against me. So, the counter claim is another way in which\\n 619  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 622}), Document(page_content='you could raise the grounds of revocation, but for that there is a prerequisite before the\\nappellate board. You can directly approach the appellate board with a revocation petition,\\nbut to approach the high court, there has to be a pre-existing infringement suit. That is\\nthe only difference; the grounds remain the same. The only requirement is that if you\\nhave to approach the high court, there has to be a pre-existing infringement suit which\\ntells you that high court proceeding is on revocation of patents are not determined by the\\nperson who raises them because you cannot choose the court somebody that the patentee\\nhas already chosen a court and filed a case against you. You can only go and defend your\\ncase. While you are defending the case, you can also challenge the patent.\\nSo, in most cases the patentee will decide which high court the patentee would approach\\nand the infringer will have to raise the defense what we call the counter claim. The claim\\nbeing the infringement itself, the counter claim is the invalidity of the patent and I have\\nalready mentioned just imagine these two proceedings are two sides of the same coin.\\n(Refer Slide Time: 15:30)\\n.\\nNow, what  are  the  grounds  that  can  be  raised  because  there  is  an  overlap  on  the\\nopposition grounds. I am going to quickly take you through this and you can always look\\ninto the grounds of opposition and the lecture on opposition, so that you can get details\\nfrom that. The first ground is that the claim was claimed in a valid claim of earlier\\npriority contained in the complete specification of any patent granted in India. This is\\nwhat we call prior claiming. We had covered prior claiming in opposition, the grounds of\\n 620  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 623}), Document(page_content='opposition, where a claim is claimed prior in time. We will say that the prior claim\\nanticipates the latter claim. So, it is a ground of anticipation and it is a ground that comes\\nunder the lack of novelty when a claim is already claimed before of an earlier priority\\ndate. So, proud claiming is the first ground. The second ground is a person was granted a\\npatent application or a patent application not entitled under the provisions of the act to\\napply.\\nSo, this ground covers the fact that a person who is not entitled to apply has applied and\\nwe know from section 6, the person who are entitled to apply are covered under section\\n6. So, if it is being done by a person who is not entitled to apply, there could be a ground\\nfor revoking the patent. The patent was wrongfully obtained in contravention of the\\nrights of a petition or any person through whom he claims. Wrongful obtainment or the\\nfact that invention was wrongfully obtained or the patent was wrongfully obtained is\\nagain a ground that is covered in opposition. D, the subject matter of any claim of a\\ncomplete  specification  is  not  an  invention  within  the  meaning  of  this  act.  Not  an\\ninvention is covered under section 3. The title of section 3 is what are not inventions.\\nNow, if there is an invention that is granted which contravenes any of the grounds under\\nsection 3, it could be objective by racing this ground 64 1 D saying that what is covered\\nin the subject matter of a claim is not an invention within the meaning of the act. So, we\\nrelate back to section 3 for this. E, the invention claimed in claim is not new having\\nregard to what is publicly known or publicly used in India before the priority date or\\nwhat was published in India or elsewhere in documents referred to in section 13. Now,\\nthis is lack of novelty because it says not new which negates novelty and the novelty\\nanalysis is done by looking at what is publicly known or publicly used in India or what is\\npublished anywhere. There is a category of documents they use that is the category of\\ndocuments in section 13, but section 13 as we have seen already is an exhaustive list of\\ndocuments. So, it covers almost everything published anywhere. So, the novelty analysis\\nis done as per the section by looking at what is published by what is known or what is\\nused before the priority date.\\n 621  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 624}), Document(page_content='(Refer Slide Time: 18:48)\\nF, the invention so far has claimed in any claim of a complete specificant is obvious or\\ndo not or does not involve any inventive step. So, what is obvious or not involving\\ninventive step is could be a ground. The section continues to say that having regard to\\nwhat was publicly known or publicly used or published in India or elsewhere. So, again\\nthe three categories are mentioned that inventive step has to be demonstrated by what is\\npublicly known, publicly used or what was published. Now, we know from the definition\\nof inventive step that the yardstick of inventive step is based on what is obvious to a\\nperson skilled in the art. So, the test of obviousness will come in and we had seen the\\nproblem and solution approach in determining inventive step. We had also the seen the\\nwinds of interest. So, all those tests would be applied in determining whether what is\\npublicly known or publicly used or published in India was obvious to a person based on\\nthe publication whether the invention would have been obvious. So, this again involves\\nthe analysis from the viewpoint of a person skilled in the art.\\nG, what is claimed is not useful. Now, this brings in third aspect of patentability. The\\ndefinition of an invention under the patents act says that the invention has to be new\\nshould involve an inventive step that is novelty, an inventive step and it should be\\ncapable of industrial application. Capable of industrial application is what we generally\\ncalled as utility or usefulness. So, if an invention is not useful or if it does not involve\\nindustrial application or you cannot make multiple copies of it, see that is a requirement\\nfor any patent to be granted 20 year life. You should be capable of replicating it in the\\n 622  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 625}), Document(page_content='manner in which it has been disclosed. So, if that is not satisfied and there are some\\nissues pertaining biological inventions where the issue of utility has been raised and in\\nthe sense that whether you could replicate them successfully in a manner in which where\\nit can be regarded as industrial applications. So, there are some issues and certain fields\\nof technology, but largely most inventions pass the test of utility. They are deemed or to\\nbe capable of industrial application and this is not a serious grounds on which patents are\\nnormally invalidated.\\n(Refer Slide Time: 21:35)\\nNow, the next ground h brings an sufficiency which is another ground and we had\\ndiscussed that sufficiency is an internal ground which the patent specification has to\\nsatisfy  its  states  and  the  specification  does  not  sufficiently  and  fairly  describe  the\\ninvention and the method by which it is to be performed. Now, this is not something that\\ngoes to the claim rather it goes to the entire complete specification. So, the invention, the\\ncomplete  specification  has  to  sufficiently  and  fairly  describe  the  invention  and  the\\nmethod by which it is to be performed. So, the method should be disclosed in a way in\\nwhich a person skilled in the art can do it.\\nNow, there is a further expansion that is to say that the description of the method or the\\ninstructions for the working of an invention as contained in the complete specification\\nare not by themselves sufficient to enable a person in India possessing average skill in an\\naverage knowledge of the art to which the invention relates toward the invention in\\n 623  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 626}), Document(page_content='summary.  This  means  what  is  disclosed  in  the  invention,  what  is  disclosed  in  the\\ncomplete  specification  is  not sufficient  to enable  a  person. So, from this  we get a\\nrequirement  in  patent  law  called  enabling  disclosure.  So,  enabling  disclosure  is  a\\nrequirement in patent law, where the disclosure made by the patentee or the applicant\\nshould be of such a nature that it enables his peer what we call enables a persons skilled\\nin the art in this particular provision. You will find the word average skill being used, but\\nwe understand that as a person skilled in the art.\\nNow, what should the disclosure do? The disclosure should enable a person skilled in the\\nart to work the invention. So, he should be able to read the specification and come up\\nwith a invention. If he read the specification and if he does everything that he knows\\nbecause he is a person skilled in the art, he would know how to work the invention and\\ndo the steps for getting towards invention and if he is yet not able to come up with a\\ninvention, then this ground can be applied. Then, the complete specification it can be\\nsaid  that  the  complete  specification  does  not  sufficiently  and  fairly  describe  the\\ninventions. It would have been possible for the person skilled in the art to come up with\\nthe invention and work the invention. So, this is tied to an age old principal in patent law\\nthat the exclusivity 20 or exclusivity is granted to the patentee in lieu of the disclosure\\nthat he makes.\\nThe disclosure should be a disclosure that teaches a person on how to come up with an\\ninvention and it is also in a way tied to the inventive step itself because an inventive step\\nis supposedly a step which a person skilled in the art could not have taken. If he could\\nhave taken that step, then we would say that it is obvious to a person skilled in the art\\nand obviously, there is no inventive strep. So, when we understand the inventive step as a\\nstep that in person skilled in the art cannot take, then the law would oblige the patentee\\nto disclose that step in a way in which the person skilled can do it after the expiry of the\\npatent. So, the patent law when it grants an exclusivity for 20 years, the grant is done in\\nreturn of a complete disclosure by the patentee on how his technology works.\\nIf the battery completely discloses it, the law also protects the patentee from others\\ncopying it because his disclosure is complete and it is there in the public domain by the\\nmechanism of infringement proceedings. So, if after the disclosure, somebody copies his\\ninvention, the patentee can enforce the patent by way of infringement suits. So, the\\nenabling disclosure is tied to the concept of an inventive step because inventive step is\\n 624  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 627}), Document(page_content='proved. When a person skilled in the art is not able to come up with the invention, it is\\nnot obvious to him. So, when something is not obvious to the person skilled in the art,\\nyou have to make it clear for him to do the invention and that making clear of a to person\\non how to come or how to come up with the invention or how to work the invention is\\nwhat is called an enabling disclosure.\\nSo, patents specifications need to have an enabling disclosure and it is requirement under\\nsection 2 and not having an enabling disclosure is a ground for revoking a patent under\\nsection 64 1h.\\n(Refer Slide Time: 26:36)\\n.\\nI, the scope of any claim is not sufficiently or clearly defined or that any claim of the\\ncomplete specification is not fairly based on the matter disclosed. There were two things\\nhere. One is definiteness i.e. the claims have to be definite. We saw in the language of\\nsection 10 that a claim have to be clear and succinct claims if they are not clear, then they\\ncould be ambiguity in constructing the claim and that could be a reason for patents not\\nperforming their notice function. Every claim in the patent performs a notice function. It\\ngives notice to the world at large as to where the borders of an intellectual property, that\\nis in this case it is a patent where the borders or the contours of a patent are or where the\\nborders or contours of an invention are.\\nSo, when the patent claim performs the function of telling third parties as to where the\\nborder of the patent is or what is the scope of the intellectual property covered by the\\n 625  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 628}), Document(page_content='patent, it requires the claim to be in a definite language. The claim has to be definite and\\nthey cannot have ambiguity in it. So, this requirement that it is that complete the claim is\\nnot sufficiently or clearly defined. If it is not sufficiently or clearly defined, it could be a\\nground for revocation. So, we saw that sufficiency is tied to the specification itself the\\ncompete specification, where as definiteness that is 64 1 i is tied to the claim. It is not\\ntied to the entire specification. So, you need to understand sufficiency or sufficiency\\ncomprises of we can look at two concepts in sufficiency. One what we already mentioned\\nin enabling disclosure and the second is best method which was also mentioned there\\nthat the patentee has to disclose the best method of working the invention.\\nSo, any enabling disclosure and best method together form the category what we call\\nsufficiency  and  sufficiency  is  tied  to  the  complete  specification  itself  whereas,\\ndefiniteness or the fact that the claim should not be ambiguous is tied to the claim. So,\\nsection 64 1 i, the first part requires the claim to be clearly defined. If they are not clearly\\ndefined, it could be a ground for revocation. So, this concept is called definiteness. The\\nsecond part says that the claim of a complete specification is not fairly based on the\\nmatter disclosed or the fact that the claims have to be fairly based on the matter disclosed\\nsomething which we already seen. So, there has to be a connect or there has to be the\\nclaim should flow from the matter that is disclosed. So, if it is not there, if the claims are\\nnot based on what is disclosed in the specification, it could be a ground for revocation.\\nSo, in this clause we have two concepts. One the claims have to be definite which means\\nthey cannot  be ambiguous  language  within the  claim  to  fair bases. Fair bases  is  a\\ncomparison of the claim to the disclosure that is already being made. If the claim uses\\ncertain language, incorporate certain parts, has certain equipments or missionary which is\\nnot mentioned in the disclosure, then we say that the claim is not fairly based on that\\nmatter disclosed.\\nA claim ideally should only cover what is in matter disclosed in the specification. So, if\\nthere are certain chemical substances used in the preparation of the claimed compound,\\nthose  chemical  substances  which  have  preceded  in  the  descriptive  part  of  the\\nspecification should figure in the claim. If the patentee needs to make a claim, the\\npatentee cannot now mention other chemical substances which he has never described in\\nhis specification. So, whatever you claimed in the claim has to be fairly based or it has to\\ngo back or related to what you have disclosed. The next ground j, the patent was obtained\\n 626  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 629}), Document(page_content='by false suggestion or representation again this involves the contact of the party. As we\\nmentioned this would require burden of proof that is ideally discharged before a court of\\nlaw and not before the controller of patents. In fact, there is no similar ground for\\nopposition under section 25.\\nK, the subject of any claim of a complete specification is not patentable under this act.\\nNow, we saw what is not in invention under the act earlier. Now, this to not patentable\\nunder the act, this pertains to inventions under section 4 relating to atomic energy l a\\nclaim what was claimed in a complete specification was secretly used in India, otherwise\\nas mentioned in subsection 3 before the priority date of the claim. Now, secret use does\\nnot amount to anticipation.

Now there is a provision where assignment have to be\\nregister  under  the  law, 69(1)  tells  us  that  where  any  person  becomes  entitled  by\\nassignment transmission or operation of law to a patent or to a share of patent. Now let\\nus  look  at  these  3  things  assignment  is  understood  as  something  that  happens  by\\nvoluntarily between 2 people transmission is something where which happens it need not\\nhappen voluntarily, but transmission can happen when a right gets vested on another\\nentity by operation of law say by bankruptcy proceedings or a person declared insolvent\\nand his creditors will take over his property and patents become a part of that then we\\nsay that the patent as changed hands by operation of law; so, any person entilted to a\\npatent by assignment by transmission or by operation of law to a patent or to a share in a\\npatent or becomes entitled as a mortgage license or otherwise to an interest in a patent.\\nNow, why do have this distinction we also saw a similar distinction in the earlier section\\n68 there is a assignment transmission or operational of law of patent or a share in patent\\nthat’s one part the second part is entitle to a mortgage licenses or otherwise to  any other\\ninterest in a patent. So, these 2 things should be understood as interest in a patent would\\nmean we should understand interest or anything like an interest when we say any other\\ninterest in a patent which means mortgagees is an interest in a patent or license is an\\ninterest in a patent. So, an interest is understood as a limited right. So, if you have a\\nmortgage then the mortgage can be redeemed and you can put an end to the mortgage if\\nthere is license the license can be put an end to it.\\nSo, as long as the mortgage continues or the license continues you have a limited right to\\nthe patent when the transaction is over the rights est back to the person who gave it you\\nin the first place, but when we talk about assignments, the assignment is a full pledged\\ntransfer of rights assignment transmission operation of law of a patent or a share in a\\npatent in those when we talk about the first part of 69 one we are referring to an absolute\\ntransfer of rights in a patent from entity a to b.

So, the interest is understood\\nas something which is limited and when we say a right in a patent or in a share in a\\npatent we understand as a whole right which covers right to do everything with regard to\\nthe patent. So, we understand these 2 paths of 69(1) as either an absolute right or a\\nconditional or a limited right. So, it covers both the scenarios, he shall apply in writing in\\nthe prescribed manner the prescribed manner is form 16 you see the cross reference there\\nto the controller for a registration of a his title or as the case may be of notice of his\\ninterest in the register. So, if he is entitled to a right he as to apply using this form to\\nregister his title if he is become an absolute owner then his name as to figure in the\\nrecords or if he is only entitled to interest. Then the notice of his interest will be enteed in\\nto the register if he is a licensee then his name will figure as the licensee if he is a\\nmortgage his name will figure as the mortgagee his name will not replace for the right of\\nthe patent holder he will not be shown as the proprietor that happens only when he is\\nentitle to the title or he becomes a owner or a co owner.\\nOnly in a such cases that is what I mention as a first part assignment transmission\\noperation of law will vest full rights in the person who is entitle to the right where as\\nmortgage license or any other interest one only rest a partial right. So, if it is a partial\\nvesting then they will be an notice of his interest if it is a full vesting of the right then the\\ntitle itself the registration of the patent will be in that name in that person’s name or in\\nthe joint name with co owners.\\n 643  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 646}), Document(page_content='(Refer Slide Time: 19:15)\\nif there are any. 2) without provisions to provisions of subsection one an application for\\nthe registration of a title of any person becoming entitled by assignment to a patent or a\\nshare in a patent or becoming entitled by a virtue of mortgage license or other instrument\\nto any interest in a patent.

The\\nworking of a patent or working of patents is a requirement that patents that have been\\ngranted should be worked. So, if you look at a spectrum of events, all patents that are\\ngranted are expected to be worked that is at the beginning of the spectrum. If some\\npatents are not worked there is a possibility given certain grounds there is a possibility to\\nget a compulsory licence issued on those patents.\\nSo, this is in the middle of the spectrum, and if despite granting a compulsory licence if\\nthe patent is not worked or the benefit of the patent is not received by the country. Then\\n 688  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 691}), Document(page_content='the patent can be revoked that’s at the end of the spectrum. So, working of the patent\\ncompulsory licences and revocation can be seen as events that would have happen in\\nsequence if certain conditions are not satisfied. So, as I mention chapter 16 is a special\\nchapter it is triggered only in special circumstances.\\nIn India we have had since the 1970 act came into force, we have only one recorded\\ninstance of grant of a compulsory licence, there been few attempts to apply for these\\ncompulsory licences, but there is only been one grant and I say one recorded grant\\nbecause there is some dispute that they could have been other instances. But right now\\nwe have if we have to if we have to directive to an order of the patent office granting a\\npatent compulsory licence; there is only one licence available. And that is a licence\\ninvolving  bias  drug  nexavar,  for  which  Natco  pharma  had  filed  a  petition  for  a\\ncompulsory licence.\\nSo, let us look at this chapter. This chapter pertains to certain special circumstances. And\\nthe special circumstances can be triggered by certain events. One of those events is the\\nfact  that  the  patent  is  not  worked  in  India.  So,  when  the  patent  is  not  worked  a\\ncompulsory licence becomes a way in which it can be made to work compulsorily. Now\\nthe easiest way for us to understand a compulsory licence is to look at it is opposite a\\nvoluntary licence. A voluntary licence is a licence that is granted by the patentee to a\\nlicensee voluntarily. The terms are agreed between them there is a contract there is an\\nagreement of licence between them, payment of royalty the territory the scope everything\\nis decided by the licence. Now when the parties are able to come to a consensus, we call\\nthat licence, voluntary licence, because the party is initiated and the parties are able to\\ntake it forward. What happens when parties are not able to come to a consensus?\\nCompany A, which is generic company wants to manufacture the technology covered in\\na patented drug. And it approaches  company B which is a originated  company the\\ncompany created the drug. Now company b does not want to grant a licence to company\\na, how do we resolve that situation? Now compulsory licence is one of the means by\\nwhich issue pertaining to a refusal to licence can be resolved. It is one of the instances,\\nbut as I already mentioned they should be certain circumstances certain grounds that are\\navailable for the licensee to make an application for a compulsory licence.\\n 689  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 692}), Document(page_content='So, once an application for compulsory licence is made before the patent office the\\ncontroller will look into the merits of it. And see whether the ingredient of the cases\\nsatisfy. And after hearing both the parties he may grant a compulsory licence. Now that\\nlicence that is granted is regarded as a licence that is granted by the patent office. So, it is\\ndifferent from the voluntary licence because parties at least the patentee was not an\\nagreement and granting that licence, it went through an adjudicatory process the patent\\ncontroller decided the case after hearing the parties, and then the patent controller impose\\nthe terms of the licence. In a volunteer licence the parties decide the terms of the licence.\\nWhere as in a compulsory licence the terms of a licence is determined by the controller.\\nSo, with this we start chapter 16 of the patents act. There are 4 kinds of applications a\\nperson can  make  for a compulsory licence.  In affect  there  are 4 different  types  of\\ncompulsory licences under the act. A person can make an application for a compulsory\\nlicence under section 84. This is the default compulsory licence under 84. An application\\ncan be made under section 91; we will see what that is. An application can also be made\\nunder section 92 and finally, an application can be made under section 92(a). These are\\nall  4  different  types  of  compulsory  licences.  The  circumstances  under  which  the\\ncircumstances under which these licences are made are different the grounds are also\\ndifferent.\\nSo, 84, 91, 92 and 92a are the 4 types of applications a person can make who wants to\\nseek a compulsory licence over an existing patent. Now before we get into section 84\\nand see how a default or what we call the ordinary compulsory licence process the way\\nin which you have apply and the grounds on which it is applied and how the matter is\\ndetermined by the controller. Before we look into that, let us look at the introductory\\nprovisions on compulsory licence.\\nSection 82 and 83 gives some introduction or a give some broad general principles on the\\nworking of patented inventions. Now let us see 82 first, 82 is has definitions usually we\\nhad mentioned this that definitions normally figure in the definitional clause. Section 2,\\nwhen  a  definition  figures  in  a  particular  chapter  then  that  definition  will  have  the\\nmeaning only for that chapter or the particular chapter when the meaning given to that\\ndefinition is confined for that chapter alone.

Rather the objective of granting a patent is that the patentee\\nwill work the invention, work the technology in the country and the country will get\\nsome advantage or some benefit by the working of the pattern. So, patents are granted\\nwith  the objective  that  the  technology will be  put into  effect  or the benefit  of the\\ntechnology will reach the citizens or the people living in that country.\\n 692  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 695}), Document(page_content='Now, in this with this objective, the countries which grant patents initially now some\\ncountries have removed the working requirement initially they had the principle that\\npatented inventions have to be worked locally. Now 83 encompasses one such principle\\nwhich was introduced into the 1970 act, without prejudice to other provisions contained\\nin the act in exercising the powers contained in by this chapter, regard shall be had to the\\nfollowing  general  considerations  namely.  These  are  all  general  principles  general\\nconsiderations  and because they are principles  the exercising the powers under this\\nchapter, there has these principles shall be considered if regard shall be had. a) patents\\nare granted to encourage inventions and to secure the inventions are worked in India on a\\ncommercial scale and to the fullest extent, that is reasonably practicable without undue\\ndelay. A clear statement that patents are granted with the objective that the inventions\\nwill be worked in India on a commercial scale and to the fullest extent; b) that they are\\nnot granted merely to enable patentees to enjoy a monopoly for importation of the\\npatented article, that patents are granted not for the patentee to import the patented\\narticle, but rather to manufacture and to make the invention available on a commercial\\nscale. c) the protection and enforcement of patent rights contribute to the promotion of\\ntechnological innovation, and to the transfer and dissemination of technology to the\\nmutual advantage of producers and users of technology to the knowledge, and in a\\nmanner  conducive  to  social  and  economic  welfare  and  to  balance  the  rights  and\\nobligations. Again we see that there is an objective served by the grant of patents, which\\nis transfer of technology. The patents require disclosures to be made of the invention, and\\nthe disclosures have to be an enabling disclosure. We know this from the requirement\\nthat the monopoly or the exclusivity is granted in lieu of the disclosure. So, if there is no\\ndisclosure of the invention or the working of the invention there is simply no patent that\\na country will grant.\\nSo, this itself acts as a transfer of technology, the fact that the patentee discloses the\\nworking of the invention and the standard of disclosure is such that a person skilled in\\nthe art will be able to make it or what enables a person skilled in the art have to make it,\\nwe can understand that by the disclosure itself the patentee has discharged his obligation\\nof disclosing the technology, in a manner in which others can do it.\\nNow, this is only part of the consideration for the grant of a patent. Working of an\\ninvention goes to the next level, it says  just not the disclosure because even if the\\n 693  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 696}), Document(page_content='disclosure is there, no person can use the technology on a commercial scale because the\\ndisclosure is a protected disclosure. A person was granted a patent gets exclusivity for 20\\nyears. So, no other person even if he knows how the patent can be worked, will be\\nallowed to embark on a commercial scale of production. For this reason countries had a\\nworking requirement. Now that the patented technology is protected exclusively and\\nthird parties cannot use the technology though they know the technology because the\\ntechnology is already disclosed in the complete specification, though they know the\\ntechnology they have to wait till the expiry of the patent. In the meantime if the patentee\\nchooses not to work the invention, then the country that grants the patent will not get the\\nbenefit of a patent grant. So, you have this requirement not only should there be an\\nenabling disclosure, which is the requirement for any patent to be granted, the patentee\\nshould also work the invention locally on a commercial scale. So, the objective of\\nworking the  invention  locally  on a commercial  scale  is  with the  objective  that  the\\ntechnology that is encompassed in the manufacture will eventually get transferred to the\\ncountry. So, there is the promotion of technological innovation and the transfer and\\ndissemination of technology, which is envisaged in the working requirement\\nd) the patents granted do not impede protection of public health and nutrition, and should\\nact as instrument to promote public interest specially in sectors of vital importance for\\nsocial economic  and technological development  of India. So, the object of granting\\npatents is that it should promote or contribute to the technological and socio economic\\ndevelopment of India, and it should act as an instrument to promote public interest, and\\nshould not impede the protection of public health and nutrition. So, if there is a patent\\nover a substance which can cure a nutritional deficiency or a nutritional deficiency in\\nyoung children, it will be in the interest of the Indian government to have that technology\\nreadily available to the masses and if nutritional substance is not available to the masses\\nat an affordable price, then the government can issue a compulsory license.\\nSo, this section 83 actually recognizes the importance of technology in the development\\nof a nation. If you look at the way in which 83 is worded, you will find that the India\\nrecognizes the role that technology plays in its development. And accordingly there are\\ncertain safeguards to ensure that the public health is and nutrition does not get impeded\\nby the grant of patents, similarly promotion of public interest is also advanced by the\\n 694  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 697}), Document(page_content='grant of patents with the objective of serving the goals of economic and technological\\ndevelopment of India.\\n (Refer Slide Time: 08:23)\\ne) patents granted do not in any way prohibit central government in taking measures to\\nprotect public health.

F) the patent right is not abused\\nby the patentee or a person deriving title or interest on patent from the patentee, and the\\npatentee or a person deriving in title or interest on patent from the patentee, does not\\nresort to practices which unreasonably restraint trade or adversely affect the international\\ntransfer of technology.\\nNow, this provision is what we call patent abuse or abuse caused by intellectual property\\nrights. Intellectual property rights once if when they are granted, it gives the discretion to\\nthe right holder to stop others from doing the act or the making the product or process\\ncovered  by  the  patent.  So,  it  gives  an  exclusivity  and  since  the  patentee  has  an\\nexclusivity, there is a possibility that the patentee would use the exclusivity to stop others\\nwhereas, he would not use the right in a positive way in which it will be available on a\\ncommercial scale.\\nSo, there is a possibility while the patent gives him the right to exclude others from using\\nthe technology, the patent does not have a obligation that the patentee should use the\\n 695  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 698}), Document(page_content='technology in India, that obligation is simply not there. So, the working requirement was\\nevolved to make the patentee discharge this obligation. Now the working requirement in\\nitself would not say that patents are granted with the objective that they will be worked,\\nthat’s no patent law has such a requirement. Rather the working requirement in patent\\nlaw would state that if the patent does not work then there will be a cause for issuing\\ncompulsory  license  so  that  others  may  work  the  invention.  Others  may  make  the\\ninvention on a commercial scale; others will supply the invention into the Indian market.\\nSo, these are the conditions for which they can be a requirement on working. g) the\\npatents are granted to make the benefit of a patented invention available at reasonably\\naffordable prices to the public. Now this is a one provision which ties the fact that an\\ninvention is patented to making it affordable to the public. Now normally patents do not\\nget into pricing of a product, but in this chapter you will find that the fact that the\\npatented product or the patented invention is not available at a reasonably affordable\\nprice to the public could be a ground for seeking a compulsory license. Now let’s look at\\nhow 84 operates.\\n 696  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 699}), Document(page_content='Patent Law for Engineers and Scientists\\nProf. Feroz Ali\\nDepartment of Management\\nIndian Institute of Technology, Madras\\nLecture – 62\\nCompulsory Licensing\\nCompulsory Licenses\\nKeywords:  Section  84/Licensing/Form  27/affordable/sealing  of  a  patent/voluntary\\nlicense/ public emergency/licensee/controller\\n(Refer Slide Time: 00:17)\\nNow 84 as I said is the default method or the default root for getting a compulsory\\nlicense. And 84 is what is normally intended when we refer to a compulsory license.\\nWhen we talk about a compulsory license the in it’s simplest form when we referring to\\n84. All the other 3 cases 91, 92, and 93 a are special forms of compulsory licenses, which\\ncan be used in certain cases. But this is the default compulsory license. At any time after\\nthe expiration of 3 years from the date of grant of patent, any person interested may\\nmake an application for the grant of the compulsory license on the following grounds.\\nSo, the first requirement in seeking a compulsory license is that the patent should have\\nbeen granted and since the grant 3 year should have elapsed. So, you cannot make a\\nrequest for a compulsory license, soon after the patent has granted, you have to wait for 3\\nyears after the grant. Now compulsory license under section 84 can be made if 3 grounds\\n 697  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 700}), Document(page_content='are satisfied. Now it can be made by a person interested, a person who has some interest\\nin the patent as defined in section 2 and 3 grounds on which the compulsory license can\\nbe sort for are a) the reasonable requirements of the public with regard to the patented\\ninvention has not been satisfied. Now this is from the public’s view point. The reasonable\\nrequirement has not been satisfied.\\nSay if there is a drug that can cure a type of cancer. And if the drug is not available in\\nlarge quantities, and assume that the prevalence of that kind of cancer in India is huge,\\nlakhs of people or even crores of people who are effected by that type of cancer. And if\\nthe drug is patented and it’s not manufactured in India. Rather the company which\\npatented the drug only imports  few thousands of doses of the drug into the Indian\\nmarket. Then that could be a case where the reasonable requirements of the public with\\nregard to the patented invention have not been satisfied, because a few thousand copies\\nof the drug cannot address the demand of larger population which may require the drug\\nin greater number. So, reasonable requirement of a public can be understood all these\\nthings have to be understood by the particular facts of a particular case. Now in this\\nscenario which I had explained could qualify that the fact that there is a great number\\nneeded and yet the number is not supplied could amount to be ground on which the\\nreasonal requirements of the public is not satisfied. \\nb) the patented invention is not available to the public at a reasonably affordable price.\\nNow the first a) was with regard to access the demand was greater than the supply. So,\\nthe ground a) was with regard to access. Ground b) is not on access, but it is on\\naffordability. So, called drug may be available in every nook and corner of the country,\\nbut it is highly priced and it is not available at an affordable price.\\nSo, the second part or the ground b) pertains to affordability, whereas ground a) was on\\naccess. So, b) tells us that if the patented invention is not available at an affordable price.\\nWhat is an affordable price? In India what amounts affordable price in India could be\\ndifferent another jurisdiction? So, all these factors will have to be considered and in the\\nonly decision that we have of the compulsory license granted for bias patented drug\\nnexavar, would show that the controller went through all these requirements before he\\ncame up with this order.\\n 698  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 701}), Document(page_content='c) the patented invention is not worked in the territory of India, it was not locally\\nworked. Now working as I said is type 2 certain other provisions of the act there is a\\nrequirement that statements of working have to be a regularly filed before the patent\\noffice, form 27 is the form that is used for filing a statements on working whether the\\npatented invention is worked on a commercial scale. So, we will we will look at the\\nworking requirement and we will see whether the working requirement is satisfied, but\\none of the grounds for seeking a compulsory license is that if the invention is not worked\\non a commercial scale in India it could be a ground for getting a compulsory license.\\n(Refer Slide Time: 05:32)\\nNow, what happens when the application is made subsection 2 tells us that an application\\nis made by any person not withstanding that is already a holder of a license under the\\npatent, and no person shall be stopped from alleging that the reasonable requirement of\\nthe public with respect to the patented inventions are not satisfied or that the patented\\ninvention is not worked in the territory of India. Or that the patented invention is not\\navailable to the public at an affordable price the 3 grounds which we just discussed. By\\nreason of any admission made by them whether in such a license or otherwise or by\\nreason of him having accepted that license.\\nNow, 2 envisages situation where the person seeking a compulsory license already has a\\nvolunteer license, a normal license. When we say a license it means a voluntary license.\\nNow regardless of the condition mentioned in that license, the holder of the license could\\n 699  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 702}), Document(page_content='still approach with for an application for a compulsory license if these 3 grounds are\\nsatisfied. So, in the license even if the patentee had made a statement to which the holder\\nof the license has agreed that it will be available at an affordable price or it is being\\nworked in India, regardless of what the terms where a licensee was agreed on those terms\\ncan still pursue a compulsory license.\\nSo, no person shall be a estopped from alleging. Now no person shall be estopped from\\nalleging means that an interested person can still allege that the invention is not worked\\nin India, even if there is an licensee for that patent. So, the 2 things we understand from\\nthis subsection is that, a licensee can make a licensee who is a voluntary licensee can\\nmake an application for a compulsory license though he has an arrangement with the\\npatentee.  And  a  person is  not stopped,  by estopped  we mean  that  a  person is  not\\nprecluded or a person is not prevented, from making the allegations under grounds a, b\\n,and c of 84(1) by reason of such a person making an admission, whether in a license or\\nby reason of having accepted a license. So, the fact that a person makes an admission\\nwith regard to any of these 3 grounds will not stop him from raising these ground or from\\nmaking an application.\\nSo, the fact that you are a licensee will not stop you from making a application for a\\ncompulsorily license, and the fact that you have made an admission that the drug is\\navailable at a reasonable price or it is being worked within the territory of India, or the\\nrequirement of the public are being met, even if you made such admission either in a\\nlicense or in some other way form, still you can make an application for a compulsory\\nlicense  raising  those  very  admissions  which  you  said  in  the  license  or  in  another\\ndocument or in some other form. And the reason a person accepts a license again will not\\nbe a ground for precluding him from making a compulsory license.\\nSo, from this we understand that a compulsory license and application for a compulsory\\nlicense can be applied for even if you hold a voluntary license. And the 3 grounds that it\\ndoes not satisfy the reasonable requirement of the public, that it is not available at an\\naffordable price and the patentee is not being worked within the territory of India, you\\ncould raise those very grounds even if you had admitted otherwise in a license or in any\\nother form.

In  effect  regardless  of  what  statement  you  have  made  your\\nstatements will not hold you back from making a compulsory license.\\n3) an application under 84(1) shall contain a statements setting out the nature of the\\napplicants interest together with such particulars as may be prescribe. And the facts upon\\nwhich they application is based. So, a person interested will have to demonstrate his\\ninterest. So, the nature of an application applicant’s interest has to be demonstrated. And\\nhe has to set out the facts on which he is making the application.4) if the controller\\nsatisfied  that  the  reasonable  requirement  of  the  public  and  respect  of  the  patented\\ninvention have not been satisfied, or the patented invention is not worked or a patented\\ninvention is not available to the public at a reasonable price, may grant a license upon\\nsuch terms as he deems fit. So, if any of the it’s not that all these conditions have to be\\nsatisfied, it is if any one of these conditions are satisfied the controller can grant a\\nlicense. And the controller will decide the terms of the license. Unlike a normal license\\nor a voluntary license where the parties will decide the term. 5) where a controller directs\\nthe patentee to grant a license he may as incidental there to exercise the powers set out in\\nsection 88. The controller has certain powers in granting compulsory licenses and they\\nare mentioned in section 88, will soon look at it. 6) in considering the application file\\nunder this section the controller shall take into account. Now the grounds are what the\\napplicant will plead and he will plead facts and he will try to make a case based on those\\n3 grounds. Now the controller if he has to grant or reject the application the controller\\nwill take into a account the following things. 1) the nature of the invention, the time\\nwhich has elapsed since the sealing of the patent. The sealing of the patent is redundant\\nbecause it was an earlier practice where the patents before they have granted they were\\nsealed it was a separate administrative action sealing, but it is been removed in every\\nother part of the patents act except this place. So, the word sealing of the patent still\\nappears here. It is an appendage that just still hangs over it does not make any sense,\\nbecause in an earlier amendment we removed sealing as an administrative step, there is\\nno sealing of patent as it was done earlier.  So, this is an remnant of the past which as\\nexisted there and hopefully in the next amendment probably this would be set right, since\\nthe grant of a patent because sealing is now replaced by grant. The time which is allowed\\nsince the grant of the patent and the measures already taken by the patentee or any\\nlicensee to make full use of the invention. So, these are the factors he will consider. The\\nability of the applicant to work the invention to the public advantage. So, if the person\\n 701  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 704}), Document(page_content='interested is a person who as only a research interest and if in another case is the person\\ninterested  is  a  competitor  who  has  manufacturing  capacity,  those  2  things  will  be\\ndifferently in considering whether a patent should be put on compulsory licenses.\\nSo, the ability of the applicant to work the invention to the public advantage is important.\\nThe capacity of the applicant to undertake the risk and providing capital and working the\\ninvention  if  the  application  were  granted.  If  the  controller  allows  the  applicant  to\\nmanufacture or allows the applicant the right to manufacture and sell the drug. Then the\\napplicant should have the capacity to do that, and especially when the applicant raises a\\nground and says that the reasonable requirement of the public is not being met, which\\nmeans the applicant should have the ability to supply that patented invention throughout\\nthe length and breadth of India to all it’s people. So, it is big requirement that the\\napplicant will have to satisfy\\n4) as to whether the applicant has made effort to obtain the license from the patentee on\\nreasonable terms and conditions and such efforts have not been successful within a\\nreasonable period, the control made deem fit.\\n(Refer Slide Time: 14:44)\\nSo, whether the they were any efforts to voluntarily get the license, provided that this\\nclause shall not be applicable in case of national emergency or other circumstances of\\nextreme urgency, or in any case of public non-commercial use or on a establishment of a\\nground of anti-competitor practices adopted by the patentee. So, in these circumstances\\n 702  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 705}), Document(page_content='the controller need not look at one 2 ,3, and 4, but shall not be required to take into\\naccount matters subsequent to the making of the application.

So, the reasonable period under this section\\nshall be understood as 6 months. So, the licensing the effort to seek a license should not\\nhave been successful within a period of 6 months. \\n7) for the purpose of the chapter the reasonable requirements of the public shall be\\ndeemed not to have been satisfied. Now this is a explanation of ground a 84(1)(a)\\nreasonable requirement now 7 describes what we understand as reasonable requirements\\nof a public. a) if by reason of refusal of the patentee to grant a license or licensee on\\nreasonable  terms.  1)  So  the  applicant  approach  the  patentee  for  a  license,  and  the\\npatentee refuse the license on reasonable terms, as a consequence one an existing trade or\\nindustry or development thereof or the establishment of any new trade or industry in\\nIndia or trade or industry in India or trade or industry of any person or class of persons\\ntrading and manufacturing in India is prejudice. So, an existing trade or an industry is\\nprejudice by not granting that license. A patentee if he does not grant license then an\\nexisting trade or industry in India or the development of that industry is affected. So, it is\\n 703  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 706}), Document(page_content='like what we can call a technology holder. The patentee who has a technology is not\\ngiving it and because it is not given a trade or an industry is prejudice or is affected\\nadversely. 2) the demand of the patented article has not been met to an adequate extent or\\non reasonable terms. There is a demand for a patented article say a lifesaving drug and it\\nis not met to an adequate extent or on reasonable terms. 3) the market for export of the\\npatented  article  manufactured  in  India  is  not  being  supplied  or  developed.  So,\\ncompulsory licenses can be granted for export. So, the market for export of the patented\\narticle manufactured in India is not been supplied or developed. 4) the establishment or\\ndevelopment of commercial activities in India is prejudiced. In one we saw that a trade\\nor industry is prejudiced here commercial activities establishment of development of\\ncommercial activities is prejudiced. Now that is a) now b) states that if the patentee\\nrefuses to grant a license if by reason of the conditions imposed by the patentee upon the\\ngrant of the license under a patent or upon the purchase hire or use of the patented article\\nor process the manufacture use or sale of materials not protected by the patent or the\\nestablishment or development of any trade in India is prejudiced.\\nSo, by the patentee not granting a license the manufacture use or sale of materials not\\nprotected by patent. Say, there is technology that is patented, and there are materials\\nwhich are used in the technology which need not be patented. If those materials supply\\nof  those  material  is  prejudiced  then  again  it  can  be  condition  whether  reasonable\\nrequirement of the public is not met. For instance, there is a technology for making a\\nmachine  which can create  paper cups, this  machine  uses only the machine  and the\\ntechnology patented. Now assume that this machine uses the special grade of paper in\\ncreating that those paper cups. And the owner of the machine, which is patented insist\\nthat the paper material for making the cups has to be procured from him., which amounts\\nto manufacture use or sale of materials not protected by the patent. The patent in itself\\ndoes not protect the quality of the paper that is used. But the patentee insist that you have\\nto buy my machine and along with the machine you have to buy paper from me. So, that\\nis a condition that is added by the patentee for which he does not have a patent. He does\\nnot have a patent on the paper or on the materials used, but he clubs it along with the sale\\nof the patented invention. In such a case we can say that this amounts to a condition that\\nis imposed which affects the sale of materials not protected by the patent. And when that\\nis prejudiced it can be regarded as a ground that satisfies 84(1)(a).\\n 704  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 707}), Document(page_content='c) if the patentee imposes a condition upon the grant of licenses under the patent to\\nprovide  exclusive  grant  back  prevention  to  challenges  to  the  validity  of  patent  or\\ncoercive package licensing. Now these are what we call restrictive trade practices or in\\ntoday’s language you can call them anti-competitive practices. So, when a person insist\\non a exclusive grant back or agrees that he will not challenges the validity of a patent, or\\ninvolves in cohesive package licensing package licensing is you cannot by single product\\nyou will have to buy package and the entire package will be licensed. There is no ability\\nfor the person pick and choose patents. The patents are given as a portfolio. Now in all\\nthese cases it can be deemed that the reasonable requirements of the public is not met.\\nThese are technically these are considered as a matters that come under competition law,\\nbut they also figured in the patents act.

So,\\nonce a license is granted it has to be ensured that it is work to the fullest extent, and it\\nalso brings to the person a profit, a reasonable profit.\\n(Refer Slide Time: 24:44)\\nSo, the terms of the license will be structured in such a way that the party who makes the\\npatented  invention who works the patented invention also own a profit. 3) that the\\npatented articles are made available to the public at reasonable affordable prices.

So,\\nif others files similar compulsory licenses on the same invention, the patentee can give\\nfurther such non-exclusive license. An exclusive licenses granted to just one person. So,\\nthey cannot be many exclusive licenses.

Though 85 is titled as non working, it also\\nincorporates  other  grounds.

The prima facie stands for a preliminary\\ncase or something which is evident on the face of the record.

Now this we have\\nsections 86 which describes the powers then we have section 87 which describes the\\nprocedure, and 88 the powers of the controller in granting the compulsory licenses and\\n89 general purposes for granting compulsory licenses and in 90 we have the terms.

Now 86, 87, 88, 89 and 90 gives us the details of the procedures. 86(1)\\nwhere an application under 84 or 85 as the case may be is made on the grounds that the\\npatented invention is not worked within the territory of India on the ground that clause d\\n 716  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 719}), Document(page_content='of subsection 7 of 84 and that the controller is satisfied and that time. Now clause d of\\nsubsection of 84 is that the patented invention is not being worked in the territory of\\nIndia on a commercial scale to an adequate extent and it is not being so worked to the\\nfullest extent that is reasonably practicable. And the controller is satisfied that the time\\nwhich  has  elapsed  since  the  sealing  of  the  patent  again  sealing  of  the  patent  we\\nunderstand at all as grant of the patent, sealing is no longer relevant this is one of the\\nremnants after the amendment where the word sealing still appears in some parts of the\\npatent done. We understand that as grant of a patent has for any reason been insufficient\\nto enable the invention to be worked on a commercial scale to an adequate extent or to\\nenable the invention to be so work to the fullest extent that is reasonably practicable he\\nmay by order adjourn the further hearing of the application for such period not exceeding\\n12 months in the aggregate as appears to him to be sufficient for the invention to be\\nworked. Now if a compulsory license is made solely on the ground that the patent is not\\nbeing  worked;  now  that  is  the  sole  ground  you  the  only  ground  for  preferring  a\\ncompulsory license is that the patent is not being worked and if such an application\\ncomes before the controller, the controller may adjourn; adjourn is postpone, adjourn the\\nhearing of the application up to 12 months by which the controller gives sufficient time\\nfor the patented invention to be worked. So, the controller rather than deciding the\\napplication and granting a compulsory license under 86(1) the controller has the power to\\nextend the time for working the invention. There is a proviso provided that in any case\\nwhere the patentee establishes that the reason why the patented invention could not be\\nworked as aforesaid before the date of the application was due to any state or central act\\nor any rule or regulation made there under and any order of the government imposed\\notherwise then by way of a condition of working of the invention in the territory of India\\nor for the disposal of the patented articles or of the articles made by a process or by the\\nuse of a patented plant machinery or apparatus then the period of adjournment ordered\\nunder this subsection shall be reckoned from the date on which the period during which\\nthe working of the invention was prevented by such act rule regulation or order of the\\ngovernment. Now, the 12 month period will also take into factor, if there was any\\nimpediment in working the invention now the proviso says if the invention could not be\\nworked due to any at state act or a central act or a rule or a regulation made by the\\ngovernment then that period will be exempted and the time will be calculated after that\\nperiod expires. So, the within the 12 month period which the controller may adjourn the\\napplication if there is an act central act or a state act or rule or a regulation made by the\\n 717  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 720}), Document(page_content='government which prevented the company or which prevented the entity from working\\nthe invention then that period will be excluded. Now, recently we had drug controller\\nwho is the authority that controls the sale of drugs in India, medicines in India. There\\ncould be instances where different authorities by under the government may regulate the\\ntrade of certain substances. For instance, if the drug controller issues an order banning\\nthe use of a particular chemical substance, the controller issues an order banning the use\\nof a particular chemical substance till there is more information available to permit its\\nuse and if there is a patented invention covering that substance the time period during\\nwhich the ban operated will be excluded for the purposes of considering the 12 months\\nunder section 86. So, this could be because if chemical, if a chemical substance over a\\npharmaceutical substance is known to have certain hazardous effects and it comes to the\\nlight of the controller, the drug controller may ban or temporarily prohibit the use of that\\nsubstance in the market. So, in such cases the controller will extend the time beyond the\\nperiod during which the ban operated. No adjournment under subsection one shall be\\nordered unless the controller is satisfied that the patentee has taken with promptitude\\nadequate and reasonable steps to start working the invention in the territory of India on a\\ncommercial scale and to an adequate extent. Now the adjournment, the 12 month time\\nperiod that the controller will give; will only be done if the controller is satisfied that the\\npatentee has taken certain steps for the working of the invention. So, 86 will only operate\\nif the patentee is able to show that the patentee has taken certain steps and has an\\nintention of working the invention. If the patentee has not done anything, then it will be\\ndifficult  for  the  patentee  to  claim  this  extension  or  the  or  an  adjournment  of  the\\napplication by one year and the controller will also not grant such an adjournment. So,\\none of the ways an applicant for a compulsory license could get over an adjournment\\nunder 86 is that one of the simplest ways if the facts and the circumstances allow will be\\nto club another ground under 84 along with local working. So, if there is a ground to do\\nthat and if the facts and circumstances allow the applicant to do that say the invention is\\nnot available at an affordable price then there cannot be in because there are 2 grounds.\\nNow  under  84  the  controller  cannot  exercise  the  power  under  86  to  adjourn  the\\napplication by 12 months.\\nNow, let’s look at the powers of the controller.\\n 718  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 721}), Document(page_content='(Refer Slide Time: 08:28)\\n88 powers of controller and granting compulsory licenses, 1) where the controller is\\nsatisfied on an application being made under section 84 that the manufacturer sale use\\nand sale of the materials not protected by the patent is prejudiced by reason of conditions\\nimposed by the patentee upon the grant of licenses under the patent or upon the purchase\\nhire or use of a patented article or process, he may subject to the provisions of that\\nsection order the grant of licenses under the patent to such customers of the applicant as\\nhe thinks fit as well as to the applicant. Now in a case  where the controller is satisfied\\nthat after an application is made under section 84 that the manufacture use or sale of\\nmaterials  which are  not protected  by the patent  is  prejudiced  by the reason  of the\\ncondition imposed by the patentee upon the grant of licenses under a patent or upon the\\npurchase hire or use of a patented article he may grant licenses under the patent to the\\ncustomers of the applicant as he thinks fit.\\nNow, this will come in when the applicant is a competitor of the patentee and the\\nmanufacturer use in sale of materials which are not protected by the patent is affected or\\nprejudiced by the conditions imposed by a patentee upon the grant of licenses under the\\npatent. Now there is a license and upon the grant of the license under the patent. The\\npatentee has imposed certain conditions condition like if you buy the machine you have\\nto buy the material that gets into the mission, we had already discussed that scenario in\\nsuch cases, it will become difficult for the applicant or the customers of the applicant to\\nbuy or to operate or to manufacture or use or sell materials which are not protected by a\\n 719  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 722}), Document(page_content='patent in such cases the controller can order the grant of licenses under the patent to the\\ncustomers of the applicant as he thinks fit. Let us take a case where there is a machine\\nwhich is patented and the machine can make paper cups the paper cups have to be made\\nwith a special material. Now if the patentee while selling the machine insist that the\\npaper cups also have to be procured from him or the materials used for making the paper\\ncup the paper has to be procured from him then that becomes a condition that prejudices\\nthe sale of materials not protected by a patent. So, it clearly falls under this provision . So,\\nin such cases the controller can grant licenses to the customers of the applicant.\\nNow, if the applicants are also using paper, but say they are using that paper for a\\ndifferent  purpose  because  the  sale  of  the  material  not  protected  by the  patent  was\\nconnected by the patentee in a license, the controller can now grant a license to the\\ncustomers of the applicant not only to the customers, but also to the applicant as well.\\n2) where an application under section 84 is made by a person being the holder of a\\nlicense under a patent the controller makes an order for the grant of a license to the\\napplicant, order the existing license to be cancelled or may if he thinks fit instead of\\nmaking an order for a grant of a license to the applicant order the existing license to be\\namended.\\nNow, this is a case where the applicant for a compulsory license holds an existing\\nlicense; a voluntary license, we will understand that as a voluntary license with the\\npatentee and we have seen that an existing licensee a voluntary licensee can still make an\\napplication for a compulsory license now. So, if there is an existing license then the\\ncontroller may cancel the existing license and grant the compulsory license or he may\\ninstead of granting a compulsory license, he may amend the existing license. So, if the\\ncontroller has the power; if the applicant for a compulsory license also has a voluntary\\nlicense in place, the controller has the choice of cancelling the voluntary license and\\ngranting the compulsory license or not granting the compulsory license and amending\\nthe existing license. 3) where two or more patents are held by the same patentee an\\napplicant for a compulsory license establishes that the reasonable requirements of the\\npatents have not been satisfied with respect to some only of the said patents then if the\\ncontroller  is  satisfied  that  the applicant  cannot  efficiently  or satisfactorily work the\\nlicense granted to him under those patents without infringing the other patents held by\\nthe  patentee  and  if  those  patents  involve  important  technical  advancement  of\\n 720  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 723}), Document(page_content='considerable economic significance in relation to other patents he may order by order\\ndirect the grant of license in respect of the other patents also enable the licensee to work\\nthe patent or patents in regard to which a license is granted under section 84.\\nNow assume that a license is granted under section 84 for a particular patent, but the\\napplicant who is now the compulsory licensee, who has the license is not able to work\\nthat patent without infringing other patents of the patentee. So, let us understand this as a\\nportfolio, there is one patent for which he has received a compulsory license, but now it\\nappears to the controller that he cannot work that patent without infringing the other\\npatents of the patentee in the portfolio which means the applicant had only sought for a\\nparticular  patent,  but  then  later  on  it  was  found  that  by working  that  patent  other\\napplications or other patents of the patentee could also be infringed in such case the\\ncontroller can order that a license be granted for all the other patents to enable the\\nlicensee to work the patent for which a license was granted under 84.\\nSo, this talks about a situation where there are overlapping patents or connected patents\\nover a particular technology if the applicant asks for a patent compulsory license for a\\npatent for the main patent as he understands the controller can also make an order for the\\ngrant of licenses for the other patents. So, that the licensee can fully enjoy the license\\nthat has been granted. So, the condition is that if the controller feels that the applicant\\ncannot efficiently or satisfactorily work the license granted to him under those patents\\nwithout infringing the other patents held by the patentee or that’s one condition or if\\nthose  patents  involved  important  technical  advancement  of  considerable  economic\\nsignificance in relation to the other patent. So, in both the cases either he is not able to\\nwork without infringing or the other patents have an important technical advancement\\nwhich could be of benefit to the licensee. In both the cases, the patent controller can\\norder licenses of patents which the applicant had not asked.\\n 721  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 724}), Document(page_content='(Refer Slide Time: 16:48)\\n4) Where the terms and conditions of the license have been settled by the controller the\\nlicensee may at any time after he worked, he has worked the invention on a commercial\\nscale for a period of not less than 2 months make an application to the controller for the\\nrevision of the terms and conditions on the ground that the terms and conditions settled\\nhave proved to be more onerous than originally expected and that in consequence thereof\\nthe licensee is unable to work the invention except at a loss provided that no such\\napplication shall be entered in the second time. Now if you  see the mechanism of\\ngranting compulsory licenses, the applicant will have to say that he has the ability to\\nmanufacture the  invention and should also give a working of how much it would cost for\\nthe applicant to do it. Now, in the course of this working if after the patent is granted the\\ncompulsory licensee feels that it has become onerous for him, it has become burdensome\\nfor him to work the invention and he is only able to work it at a loss.

We need to bear in mind the grounds on\\nwhich it can be granted, the procedure that needs to be followed, how long the licence\\n 723  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 726}), Document(page_content='can be kept and the powers of the controller in granting these licences, that is section 84\\ntill section 90 we had already covered them. So, you need to bear the details from section\\n84 to section 90 in mind so that you understand 91 better, because 91 presents an entirely\\ndifferent picture of four of the use of compulsory licenses\\nNow, 91 specifically pertains to related patents. Related patents in the sense that you\\nhave a patent and in the same field of technology there is a related patent which does not\\nbelong to you related in the sense of the technology is so close to your technology or for\\ninstance you cannot work your patent efficiently without infringing the other patent or\\nwithout use of the other patent so, but the only difficulty is that the other patent belongs\\nto another patentee. \\nSo, in such cases you could approach the patent controller, seeking a licence of a related\\npatent. Now the criterion here is that your technology and the technology covered by the\\nrelated patent another patent is technology should be related to one another, it cannot be\\nchalk and cheese it has to be related it there has to be some connection between these\\ntwo patents. In that case if you are not able to work your pattern without seeking a\\nlicence from the other person, and the other person is not willing to grant a licence for\\nyou, to you, then you can approach the controller for a compulsory licence.\\nSo, the ground rather the only ground on which you can seek a patent is that you cannot\\nwork your invention effectively, because of another patent and the patentee of the other\\npatent is not granting you a licence and these two technologies or the inventions covered\\nin these two patents are related to each other. Now you will see how different this is from\\nthe  compulsory licences  that  are  granted  under  section  84.  84 had  certain  grounds\\nreasonable requirements not met, affordable price not met, not work locally, this does not\\npertain to any such ground the only requirement here is that you cannot work your\\ninvention without the use of another person’s patent and that patent is not being available\\nmade available to you on a licence.\\nNow, let’s look at the details of this section and just how the ground is are different the\\nway in which this operates are also this provision operates is also different. We had seen\\nin 84 that the patent should have been granted and it has to be three years since the patent\\ndoes  grant being granted  and only then you  can make  an application  for a licence\\n 724  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 727}), Document(page_content='compulsory licence under 84. 94 does not have a similar requirement and in fact, you\\ncould say that 91 does not have a similar requirement. \\nIn fact, you can look at the procedure in 91 it appears to be a fast track procedure;\\nbecause here is a situation where a patent is available or the patentee is not able to work\\nhis invention effectively, not because of any difficulty from his end because there is\\nanother patent and he is not able to get a licence to that patents. So, this is more like\\nenabling  technologies  to  be  worked  more  efficiently,  you  might  have  heard  about\\ntechnology holdup or patent hold up when patents can be used to hold up, others from\\nworking around or working in a particular technology. So, 91 solves the issue of patent\\nhold up; if you are working in a related technology and if you find that there is another\\npatent that is hindering your working, then you could seek a license. Now, let’s look at\\nthe details of this section 91(1) not withstanding anything contained in other provisions\\nof this chapter which includes section 84 and a default section compulsory license under\\nthat section, at any time after the sealing of a patent we had already mentioned our\\nsealing is a remnant of the past which the last amendment did’nt take care of you should\\nread that as at any time after the grant of a patent. Sealing used to be a step before the\\ngrant of a patent now it is no longer relevant, and the last amendment to the patent act\\nactually removed all evidences of sealing except in this chapter the chapter pertaining to\\ncompulsory license. \\nSo, we read this at as at any time after the grant of a patent any person who has the right\\nto work any other patented invention either as a patentee or a licensee thereof. So, the\\nrequirement under 91 is that you should be able to work up you should have some right\\nto work a patented invention, either on your own as the patentee or as a license or as a\\nlicensee  exclusive  or  otherwise.  So,  it  converts  both  exclusive  and  non-exclusive\\nlicenses, may apply to the controller for the grant of a license of the first mentioned\\npatent on the ground that he is prevented or hindered without such a license  from\\nworking the other invention effectively or to the best possible best advantage possible.\\nNow, the patentee is not able to work as invention effective without a license, of the\\nanother patent, which belongs to another patentee. 2) no order under subsection one shall\\nbe made unless the controller is satisfied, 1) the applicant is able and willing to grant or\\nprocure the grant to the patentee and his licensee if they so desire of a license and respect\\nof the other invention on reasonable terms, this is nothing, but cross licensing.

Now we saw that there are general provision under 87 which\\ndeals with the procedure to be followed in 84 and 85 and 88. 88 deals with powers of the\\ncontroller in settling the terms of the licence and 89 deals with the general purposes of\\nfor granting licenses and 90 deals with the terms on which for instance we saw that one\\nof the terms on which licence under 84 shall be granted is that the right of the license is\\nnon assignable. So, those terms will again apply in cases involving compulsory license\\nunder section 91.\\nNow, what is important here is the grounds in 84 will not apply for a compulsory licence\\nunder section 91. So, we saw that they were certain elaborate grounds and we also saw\\nthat the grounds were enumerated what reasonable requirement is, it enumerated under\\nsubsection 7 of section 84.

Whereas  84 we saw  that,  84 is  market  initiated  a person who has  the\\ncapacity to manufacture can approach the controller with a license so it is market driven. \\n 728  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 731}), Document(page_content='91 is also market driven in the sense that a competitor can approach the controller\\nseeking a compulsory license as and when there is a need again that is market driven. 92\\nis not market driven. 92 the central government has to first pass a notification. So, the\\npower to initiate a 92 license should first begin with the central government issuing a\\nnotification,  and  only  then  92  can  be  even  implemented.  So,  you  cannot  make  an\\napplication under 92 directly to the government which was done recently in a case and\\nrightly the government rejected it. Because the prerequisite for a 92 license is that the\\ngovernment has to issue a notification.  You can ask the government or request the\\ngovernment  to  issue  a  notification  site  citing  the  need,  but  you  cannot  make  an\\napplication till such notification is issued. So, if a question is asked can a compulsory\\nlicense under section 92 be filed by a party.  If the party feels that the conditions under 84\\nfor all the 3 conditions are satisfied can a party seek a 92 license. The answer is no, a 92\\nlicense can only be sought for after the government has issued a notification. So, unless\\nthe  government  issues  a  notification  you  cannot  approach  the  controller  with  a  92\\nlicense. So, that’s the key distinction between a 84 license and a 92 license. An 84 license\\ndoes not require a government notification, 92 license you cannot do anything unless\\nthere is a government notification.\\nNow, let us look at the details, 92(1) If the central government is satisfied in respect of\\nany patent enforce in circumstances of national emergency, that’s the first condition or in\\ncircumstances of extreme emergency.

So, the first step for 92 to be activated\\nor for seeking a compulsory license under 92, the first step would be to look at whether\\nthe government has issued a notification under in the official gazette.\\nSo, the condition for a 92 is that there has to be a declaration. By notification in the\\nofficial gazette the official gazette is the official record by which government makes\\npublic Announcements.\\nSo, something is published in the official gazette it is a record that something has been\\npublished by the government. So, a notification in the official gazette is a requirement.\\n 729  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 732}), Document(page_content=\"Once the  notification  is  made,  now what are the  conditions  for that to trigger  that\\nnotification? 1)  in respect of a patent that is in force.

We  will  explain  these  things  soon,  but  in  these\\ncircumstances compulsory license can be granted after the grant of the patent anytime\\nthere is no 3 year limit. If the government makes a notification to that effect saying that\\nthere can be a compulsory license in lieu of national emergency extreme urgency or\\npublic,  non-commercial  use.  Whatever  the  condition  the  government  can  make  a\\nnotification only then the procedure under 92 can actually be initiated.\\nNow, let  us  look  at  the  procedure  after  the  notification.  So,  let  us  assume  that  a\\nnotification  is  there,  now  the  controller  shall  one  says  that  the  controller  shall  on\\napplication made at any time after the notification by any person interested grant the\\napplicant a license under the patent on such terms as he thinks fit.\\nSo, once the notification is made any person interested shall make an application and the\\ncontroller can grant. 2) In settling the terms and conditions of the license granted under\\nthis section the controller shall endeavor to secure that the articles manufacturer under\\nthe patent shall be available to the public at the lowest prices consistent with the patentee\\nderiving a reasonable advantage for their patent rights.

The controller shall grant the compulsory license. 2 in settling\\nthe terms he shall ensure that that article that patented article is available at the lowest\\nprice and also ensure that the patentee gets a royalty.\\nBecause in every compulsory license what the controller is in effect allowing is the use\\nthe manufacture and sale of the patented product by a third party other than the patentee.\\nThis is the effect of a compulsory license. When a compulsory license is granted on the\\nterms  that  a controller  decides, the  controller  is  in  effect  allowing  a third party to\\nmanufacture and sell the patented invention at a price which will; obviously, be lesser\\nthan the price at which the patentee is selling.\\nNow, whatever price the controller fixes? The controller will also ensure that a royalty is\\npaid back to the patentee. This is a part of any license. A license would allow you to use\\nanother person's patent in lieu of a royalty.

You are allowed to use\\nthe technology, though not by the patentee by an order of the controller. So, that is why\\nwe call it compulsory. You are allowed to use the technology and because you are using\\nthe technology you have to pay back a royalty to the patentee. So, the controller shall\\nensure that  the  lowest price  is  fixed  at the  same  time  by fixing the  lower price  a\\nreasonable royalty an advantage here the word advantage is used is also given to the\\npatentee.\\nProvisions of section 83. 83 are the terms  on which general terms  for the grant of\\ncompulsory license - 87, 88, 89 90 shall apply with regard to this section as it applies to a\\nsection under 84.

Now if you have seen that the\\ncontroller makes a prima facie assessment that there is a case, and then he asks the party\\nto serve copies on the patentee. The patentee can oppose notice of opposition is given,\\nthe controller hears both the sides and then passes an order. Now this is the procedure\\nunder 87.

Now the question may arise then what was the arrangement before the appellate\\nboard came into a force. The arrangement was every matter which could be taken up an\\nappeal over a decision of the patent office would lie as an appeal to the high court to the\\nrespective high court. So, the appellate board was created under the trademarks act, but\\nthe appellate board for the purposes of discharging the functions under the patents act\\nwas notified only many years later on and this had to be done because when the act took\\naway the powers of the high court and vested in the appellate board the appellate board\\nalso needed the personal who could handle that. So, if you look at the appellate board\\nthere is a technical member who has a background in patent who sits along with the\\njudicial member the judicial member is also called the chairman.\\nSo, together the bench discharges functions of largely looking at appeals from the patent\\noffice, the appellate board can also look into appeals from the central government. We\\nknow that in certain cases, the central government is vested with certain powers under\\nthe patents act, the appellate board though it is called the appellate board, it also has\\noriginal jurisdiction. Now the appellate jurisdiction is where there is an existing order\\npassed by an inferior court or by an inferior body which can be taken up in appeal. Now\\nthe scope of an appeal is limited you cannot agitate a ground that has not been agitated\\nbefore the inferior court or organization.\\nSo, in that sense appeal is more like a higher organization or a higher judicial body\\nlooking  into  the  decision  that  is  already  made  by  an  inferior  body. So,  appeal  is\\nsomething that there is the mandate is already set, the case is already been decided by\\ninferior body and the superior body looks into the reasoning and the conclusion that the\\ninferior body has come up with and to see whether it stands certain checks. The original\\njurisdiction refers to the ability of a party to approach with a list by list we mean with an\\nissue to a body for the first time meaning which, the matter has not been agitated before\\n 747  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 750}), Document(page_content='in an inferior body or in any other body, but the matter is first introduced for the first\\ntime before the decision making body.\\nSo, the appellate board not only has the power to look at appeals from the patent office, it\\nalso has original jurisdiction by which, we mean the power to consider matters directly\\neven in the absence of an appeal or even in the absence of an impugned order. An\\nimpugned order is an order which is been challenged and it presumes that that order was\\npassed by an inferior body inferior decision making body. The appellate board though it\\nis called the appellate board, it also has powers other than deciding appeals. Those\\npowers we refer to them as original jurisdiction of the appellate board. Now the original\\njurisdiction of the appellate board as we will see in the provisions pertain to 2 broad\\ncategories, one it has the power to look at revocation. So, you can file a petition for\\nrevocation  not  an  appeal  you  can  file  a  petition  for  revocation  directly  before  the\\nappellate board and that can be the first instance your agitating that issue under section\\n64.\\nSo, that refers to the original power of the appellate board; another original power of the\\nappellate board and original power also means that this power is exclusively vested with\\nthe  appellate  board  because  there  is  a  power,  there  is  a  provision  which  confers\\nexclusivity on or bar on jurisdiction of the other bodies on the appellate board and this is\\nnormally been done because when tribunals takeover functions which were previously\\ndischarged by the high courts or by the lower courts, there you  will normally find\\nprovision where it bars or it prohibits approaching those courts or any other court for\\nrelief because now you have a specialized organization discharging this function we\\ndon’t want a multiple litigation or what is commonly called forum shopping people\\napproaching different forums for getting the same relief.\\nSo,  you  have  various  baring  provisions  and  the  appellate  board  also  has  a barring\\nprovision where you cannot approach any other court for relief except the appellate\\nboard. So, the two broad original jurisdiction involves the power to receive a petition for\\nrevocation and a power to rectify the register rectification proceedings. So, under 64,\\nsection 64 and under section 71, the appellate board has power to look into matters even\\nin the absence of an appeal. So, that is what we call an original jurisdiction.\\n 748  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 751}), Document(page_content='Now, the appellate board 116 tells us that the appellate board is the same board that was\\nestablished  under  the  trademarks  act  1999,  but  the  only  difference  being  that  the\\ntechnical member of the appellate board shall have qualifications pertaining to patent law\\na in trademark law, the person need not have qualifications pertaining to patent law.

So, when there is already been a transfer unless it is\\nmade very clear that you can’t go back then you could be in a situation where parties are\\nusing the old system and the new system.

Now all  this  while  we were looking at filing  an application  for a patent\\nprosecuting the patent in the patent office. The patent being granted there have been\\ncertain  corrections;  how  the  register  is  maintained,  how  the  patent  office  functions\\npowers of the controller, we saw various things pertaining to the grant and the process of\\ngrant of a patent. We also saw after grant; how can we; how can a patent be  licensed;\\nthat is compulsory licensing and in cases where the government is interested, how it can\\nbe acquired.\\n 755  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 758}), Document(page_content='We had not seen anything on enforcement of the patent. So, for whatever we have seen\\npertain to the process of granting of patents and how the granted patent operates within\\nthe patent office, if it is granted, you could file up after waiting for 3 years, you could file\\na compulsory license of the different varieties, there are certain compulsory licenses for\\nwhich you do not have to wait in all these cases. We are not looking at the patentee\\nenforcing the rights in a patent. So, this chapter specifically deals with enforcement of\\nthe patent, right. So, once you have a grant and you find that a competitor is using the\\ntechnology that is covered by your patent or in other words the competitor is infringing\\nyour patent.\\nThen there is an option for the patentee to approach the court and get certain reliefs. Now\\nwhich court does he approach. So, that is decided in 104. Now which court does he\\napproach? It could be the court where if he gets a relief from that court, it could be\\nbinding on the defendant. So, that is the most logical step; any patentee would take, the\\npatentee would want a court to give a decision in an infringement suit where it can be\\nenforced on the defendant. So, for instance if the defendant is in Assam and the patentee\\nis in Delhi and the patentee files a case in Delhi and tries to serve a notice on the\\ndefendant who is in Guwahati, they may be difficulty in serving the notice and even if\\nyou receives the notice; that person will have to come and appear here and order passed\\nby the Delhi high court has to be enforced in a different jurisdictional territory this can\\nall lead to difficulties.\\nSo, the act tells us which courts have jurisdiction and if you know how courts are\\nstructured. We have the lower courts; by the lower courts, we can refer to those courts at\\nthe Muncips courts and above that we have the district courts which are the civil courts\\nand the district courts are much similar to the sessions court, which have power over\\ncriminal matters and above the district court, you have the high court and above the high\\ncourt, you have the supreme court. Now this is the hierarchy of courts in India.\\nCan you file an infringement suit before a Muncip court which is the lowered lowest\\ncourt? you can’t. So, 104 tells you which court has been empowered with the jurisdiction\\nwhich means which are the courts that can take up a case of infringement. So, 104 tells\\nus that no suit for declaration under 105, we will see what 105 is or any relief under 106\\nwhich is also a declaratory suit, but not pertaining to infringement of a patent 105 and\\n102 do not pertain to infringement of a patent or for infringement of patent.

So, a case is filed for the first time or can be filed for the first time\\nbefore the district court or in some cases in the high court where the high court has a\\noriginal jurisdiction where the high court has or is empowered to determine matters at\\nthe first instance.\\nNow, this clause that approach the district court has a small exception to it. Now you\\nwould  normally  approach  the  district  court,  but  if  after  you  file  the  case  for  an\\ninfringement suit a counter claim for revocation of a patent is made by the defendant. So,\\nin an infringement suit the patentee has filed an infringement suit and the defendant who\\nis the alleged infringer makes a counter claim, a counter claim is a claim against another\\nclaim; a counter claim for revocation meaning which the patentee tries to enforce the\\npatent by filing an infringement suit and the defendant who is the other party in that\\ninfringement suit raises a defense that this patent is invalid you can raise all the grounds\\nof invalidation or revocation under 64.\\n 757  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 760}), Document(page_content='So, when a claim for revocation is raised by the defendant the suit along with the counter\\nclaim shall be transferred to the high court for decision.

So, if the facts allow the\\ndefendant to raise invalidity of the patent as a defense to say that if you are alleging\\ninfringement in turn I am alleging your patent is invalid. So, if the defendant can take\\nthat or the defendant can takes that counter claim the suit has now if it was filed before a\\ndistrict court it has to be transferred to the high court. Now what is the reason behind it;\\nwe will soon find it because there are certain other provisions of the patents act which\\nmay throw some light as to why we have this provision that has been where the suit has\\nnow to be transferred to the high court for a decision.\\n(Refer Slide Time: 08:48)\\n 758  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 761}), Document(page_content='In section 104, we saw the jurisdiction or the power of the court to take up a matter\\npertaining to a patent infringement or a declaratory suit pertaining to section 105 and 106\\nwe saw the courts that can take up in matter pertaining to these sections and we also saw\\nthat it had to be the court not inferior than a district court. Now of these 3 categories of\\nsuits a declaratory suit under 105 a declaratory suit under 106 and an infringement suit\\nan infringement suit, we would rather, we would call it a suit under 108 because a reliefs\\nin a suit for infringement are determined by that section.\\nSo, there is no separate section on infringement of patents we have 107 on defenses that\\ncan be raised in an infringement suit and 108 which details the relief. So, in a suit for\\ninfringement and we understand these 2 types of suits or types of cases as provisions that\\nare there to assist either the patentee or the defendant or the potential infringer or the\\ncompetitor. An infringement suit can be filed by a patentee. Whereas, the declaratory\\nsuits under 105 and 106 can be filed by a person who would be affected by the patent in\\nmost cases we can call that person a competitor or we could also called that person a\\npotential infringer.\\nSo, right now, we are going to concentrate on the provisions of infringement suit and\\ninfringement suit once we complete infringement suit, we will come back to 105 and 106\\nN.ormally in a case, the burden of discharging the proof what we call the burden of proof\\nrest on the person who alleges a fact to be true, if a person alleges a particular fact to be\\ntrue then the burden is on that person to prove it.

So, he will have the certificate of a patent as a document in the suit and he\\nwill also have a proof of infringement, if it is a product then he will he would have\\npurchase that product or if it is a process then he would have some description about the\\nprocess or the product the dresses from the process and he will make a comparison\\nbetween what he has patented to the infringing product or process and try to prove\\ninfringement.

Now let us look at one such case, section 104A describes a case where the\\nburden shifts on the defendant. So, when the patentee alleges infringement the burden of\\nproving infringement in particular cases will shift on the defendant let us look at that\\ncase 104A (1) in any suit for infringement of a patent where the subject matter of the\\npatent is a process for obtaining a product. So, it has to be the patent should pertain to a\\nprocess the court may direct the defendant to prove that the process used by him to\\nobtain the product identical to the product of the patented process is different from the\\npatented process, if the subject matter of the patent is a process for obtaining a new\\nproduct or there is substantially likelihood that the identical product is made by the\\nprocess and the patentee or a person deriving title or interest in the patent from him has\\nbeen unable through reasonable efforts to determine the process actually used provided\\nthat the patentee or a person deriving title or interest in the patent from him first prove\\nthat the product is identical to the product directly obtained by the patented process.\\nSo, the section contains certain steps certain responsibilities. So, the first responsibility is\\non the patentee and that you will find in the proviso which starts here. Now the first\\nresponsibility is that the patentee or the person deriving title or interest first proves that\\nthe product is identical to the product directly obtained by the patented process. So, the\\ninitial burden is on the patentee to prove that the product created by the process which\\nthe defendants using is identical to the product that has been patented. So, what requires\\nto be done there has to be a product to product mapping product to product mapping in\\nthe sense that the product created by the defendant should be mapped with the patented\\nwith  the  product  directly  obtained  by  the  patented  process  which  we  will  capture\\ncaptured in a patents specification.\\nSo, this much the patentee will have to do the patentee we will have to take the product\\nof the defendant and show that the product is identical to the product that is directly\\nobtained by the patented process. Now once the patentee discharges this burden then the\\nburden will shift to the defendant; what you can find here? The court may direct the\\ndefendant to prove that the process used by him to obtain the product is different from\\nthe process .Now this is what the defendant would prove. Now if the defendant has a\\ndefense then the defend will try to prove that it may appear identical, but the process I\\nhave used is different.\\n 760  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 763}), Document(page_content='Now, why does the burden shift on to the defendant the reasons are given in a and b, the\\nburden will shift to the defendant if the subject matter of a patent is a process for\\nobtaining a new product which means the new product if the defendant case is that the\\nnew  product  could  be  created  by  different  processes  and  the  process  used  by  the\\ndefendant is different from the process that is being used by the patentee. So, the first\\nreasoning of the defendant to demonstrate that he is using a different process would\\nrequire that the subject matter of the patent is a process for obtaining a new product and\\nwe know that is the subject matter of the patent is the product itself then the product will\\ncover always all methods of manufacture or making and a product patent will is a much\\nmore comprehensive right. So, this section will step in 104A will step in only if the\\nsubject matter of a patent is a process for obtaining a new product.\\nSo, that is a requirement for this section to be applied where the dispute is with regard to\\nproduct itself which is patented this section will not have any bearing. So, the facts that\\nattract this section require the dispute or the subject matter of the dispute to be covered\\nby a process patent rather than a product patent and once the patentee raises an objection\\nor is able to prove that the defendant product is identical to his patented process, then the\\ndefendant can raise in defense saying that he is using a different patented process. Now\\nthe conditions; A) the subject matter of the patent should be a process for obtaining a\\nnew product or there is a substantial likelihood that the identical product is made by the\\nprocess and the patentee has been or the person deriving title a through him has been\\nunable by through reasonable efforts to determine the process actually used.\\nSo, that burden again shifts because the patentee is unable to determine; what is been the\\nproduct process that has been used. So, there is a substantial likelihood that the identical\\nproduct is made by the process, but the patentee is not able to know what that processes.\\nSo, in these 2 cases or in either of these cases the burden would shift on the defendant\\nand the defendant, if he has to come clean in an infringement suit, one of the defenses\\navailable to him is to say that he is non-infringing that is the first line of defense. If a\\ninfringement suit is filed against a person the first line of defense could be to say that\\nthere is an allegation of infringement; what I am doing does not amount to infringement\\nthis is the defense of non-infringement my activity does not infringe the patent.\\n 761  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 764}), Document(page_content='(Refer Slide Time: 19:06)\\nNow, 2 continuous in considering whether a party has discharged the burden imposed\\nupon  him  by  subsection  one,  the  court  shall  not  require  him  to  disclose  any\\nmanufacturing  or  commercial  secrets  if  it  appears  to  the  court  that  it  would  be\\nunreasonable  to  do  so,  so  there  is  a  protection  for  disclosing  manufacturing  and\\ncommercial street secrets, what we could also called trade secrets.

So, when the defendant says that my process is different he has\\nto demonstrate that he is using a different process.\\nNow, in cases where the defendant fields that his trade secret or commercial secret or\\nmanufacturing secret could be revealed, there is a protection in subsection 2 which the\\n 762  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 765}), Document(page_content='court can take care of and the court can ask for a confidential disclosure. Now we saw\\nthat the first defense in 104A, we saw that the first defense that the defendant can take\\nwhen a suit for infringement or in an infringement cases filed against him is to say that\\nthe activity I am engaging in does not amount to infringement like we saw in 104A, the\\ndefendant can actually say the processes is different which means it does not amount to\\ninfringement.\\nSo, that is the defense of non infringement and we say that that is the first line of defense\\na person can take to say that the matter that is covered by the patent is not being done by\\nthe defendant. So, what the defendant is doing is different from what is covered in the\\npatent and hence we say that there is no infringement and we call that to be the defense\\nof non-infringement. There are other defenses allowed in the patents act, 107 list the\\ndefenses that can be raised in a suit for infringement 107(1) states that in any suit for\\ninfringement of a patent every ground on which it may be revoked under section 64 shall\\nwe shall be available as a ground for defense.\\nSo, all the grounds under 64 by which you could revoke a patent can be raised as a\\ndefense in an infringement suit which means the defendant can apart from saying he is\\nnon-infringing which is the first line of defense, in addition to that he could also say that\\nthe patent is invalid and seek its revocation and we saw the grounds in 64, there are\\nmany grounds, the defendant could depending on the facts and circumstances of the case\\nthe defendant could use multiple grounds to say that the patent is invalid and needs to be\\nrevoked or the patent was obtained by wrongful contact and needs to be revoked there\\nare multiple section 64 is not just invalidation of patent, but revocation results in an\\ninvalidation. So, that is why we call it the defense of invalidity.\\nSo, first in 104A, we saw the defense of non-infringement that a defendant can take non\\ninfringement as a defense saying that what he is doing is different from what is covered\\nby the patent, the second defense or alternatively or in addition to that defense the\\ndefendant can raise invalidity as a defense invalidity. By invalidity, we mean that the\\npatent  can be revoked for grounds  that  are mentioned  in section 64. Now  we had\\nmentioned that infringement and invalidity are like sides of a same coin on one side of\\nthe patent there is the fact that the patent if it is valid, it can be enforced and enforcement\\nis done through infringement proceedings you do not want people who are using your\\ninvention without paying you a royalty to exist.\\n 763  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 766}), Document(page_content='So, what you would do is you will file cases against them allege infringement prove it\\nand stop them from using your invention. So, this is what we call the enforcement part of\\na patent this is one side of the coin at the same time the patent is also susceptible to an\\ninvalidity challenge. An invalidity challenge is if the patent has to be enforced the patent\\nin the first place has to be valid, you cannot enforce a invalid patent. So, when the\\ndefendant raises challenges to invalidity which could be the patent lacks novelty there is\\nno novelty the patent lacks inventive step there is no utility in the patent and a host of\\nother grounds that are available under 64. So, this part of the coin that is the validity part\\ncan be challenged by the defendant. So, the patent in a same proceeding in the preceding\\nin which the patentee tries to enforce the patent by filing an infringement suit, the\\ndefendant can raise invalidity as a challenge. So, that both infringement and invalidity\\ncan be determined by the same court.\\nNormally the court will look at invalidity first. The reason being if the patent is invalid,\\nthere is no need for the court to look into the issue of infringement, if the patent is held to\\nbe  valid then  the  court will  look at  whether  there  is  infringement  or not. So, if a\\ndefendant raises 64 the grounds in 64 in addition to a defense that his process is different\\nand he is non-infringing, the court will first look into the 64 grounds and the court will\\nfirst look at the issue whether the patent is valid in the first place. Once the patent is held\\nto be valid then the court will look at infringement, the allegation of infringement and\\nsee whether the defense of infringement holds good and at the end the court will come to\\na conclusion whether there is an infringement and whether the reliefs for infringement\\ncan be granted as claimed by the patentee.\\nSo, the defenses in a suit of infringement, we saw that they could be non infringement\\ncould  be  a  defense  104A  describes  non  infringement  a  particular  type  of  non\\ninfringement pertaining to patented processes, invalidity could be a defense and 107(1)\\ntalks about invalidity, 107(2) states that in any suit for infringement of a patent by the\\nmaking using or importation of any machine apparatus or other article or by using any\\nprocess or by importation use or distribution of any medicine or drug, it shall be a ground\\nfor defense that such making using importation or distribution is in accordance with any\\nor more of the condition specified in section 47.\\nNow, section 47, we found we had seen that already that section 47 pertains to certain\\nconditions  on  which  a  patent  is  granted  the  grant  of a  patent  is  subject  to  certain\\n 764  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 767}), Document(page_content='conditions now and the wording is again repeated here and we had given the cross\\nreference to section 47 for that reason you will find that there are certain things that\\nsubject to which a patent is granted. So, if those things happen or of a person engage in\\nthose things then it will be regarded as a defense it will be a ground for defense. For\\ninstance a person is importing using or distributing any medicine or drug as mentioned in\\nsection 47 then that will be a defense in a suit for infringement.\\nSo, we can regard these as the statutory defenses. These are the statutory defenses\\nbecause they are contained in the statute. So, we have seen 3 types of defenses the first\\ndefense is the defense of non infringement, the second as a defense of invalidity raising\\nthe grounds under section 64 to invalidate the patent and eventually revoke it and the\\nthird set of defenses are the statutory defenses. Now the statutory defenses also include\\nwhat we can find in 107A. Now 107A was introduced by an amendment in the year\\n2002. So, that is why it figures as a separate section. So, it is we can understand that as\\nanother statutory defense or another set of statutory defenses available in an infringement\\nsuit.\\n(Refer Slide Time: 29:51)\\nNow, let us look at 107A. Now 107A is divided into 2 parts, a is what is generally called\\nthe Bolar exemption or the Bolar exception and b pertains to what we call parallel\\nimportation. So, a pertains to what is an known patent law as the Bolar exemption and b\\npertains to the defense of parallel importation. Now let us take a; now 107A reads for the\\n 765  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 768}), Document(page_content='purpose of this act, there is a and b and it continue saying that shall not be considered as\\ninfringement of patent rights. So, a and b what is contained in a and b will not be\\nregarded as infringement of a patent, right.\\n(Refer Slide Time: 30:40)\\nNow, let us look at a first, any act of making constructing using selling or importing a\\npatented invention solely for uses reasonably relating to development and submission of\\ninformation required under any law for the time being in force in India or in a country\\nother than India that regulates the manufacture construction use sale or import of any\\nproduct. Now what you need to understand is if a person makes constructs use sells or\\nimports  a  patented  invention  for  uses  relating  to  development  and  submission  of\\ninformation required under any law in India or elsewhere any law in any part of the\\nworld.\\nNow, this would mean a defendant can import or he can make use even sell even sell\\ncertain quantities of the patented invention provided that use pertains to development and\\nsubmission of information required under any law. Now let us look at there is an some\\ndetail. Now assume that the drug regulatory authority in India requires certain tests to be\\ndone before the drug can be approved. Now also assume that that particular drug is\\npatented in India and the patent holder is a different company. Now if a company in India\\nwants to get a marketing approval, they will have to submit certain tests to show that\\n 766  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 769}), Document(page_content='their drug is an equivalent or their drug is a bio-equivalent to an existing drug so, that\\nthey can also get an approval from the drug regulatory authority.\\nNow, normally in a normal case, we know from the wording of section 48 that an act of\\nmanufacture an act of using an act of selling would amount to infringement, but an\\nexception is made here if that act is being done for the purpose of development and\\nsubmission of information required under any law. So, if the drug controller or the drug\\nregulatory authority requires information on that patented process to be submitted and a\\ncompany mix that submission which would involve use of a patented invention that will\\nnot amount to infringement because this section protects statutorily the person from\\ndoing such acts, the reason for this is that assume that a patent will expire in the year\\n2018 say on January first 2018 a patent would expire.\\nNow, a generic company in India which is interested in manufacturing that article post\\nexpiry of the patent which when it falls into the public domain can do some preparatory\\nwork, get all the approvals have everything in place. So, that the day the patent expires\\nthe next day, they can launch their product in the market. So, this provision exists to\\nensure that the time taken in doing the preparatory work in launching a drug, this is\\nespecially true for drugs in launching a drug which is patented can be cut down by\\ngetting approvals that are mandated by the law where such approval require submission\\nof information development and submission of information. So, the purpose of this is to\\nensure that when a patent expires immediately other people can manufacture and supply.\\nNow, normally if there is no regulator this provision will not be required it all. Assume\\nthat there is a paper clip patent and the paper clip patent will expire on Jan 1 2018, a\\ncompetitor who wants to flood the market with pins the very next day can have all the\\nnecessary ingredients stocked up in his premises in his manufacturing unit and then day\\nthe patent expires, he can start manufacturing and he can flood the market with his goods\\nbecause now the patent has expired. In a product like a paper clip there is no requirement\\nfor a regulatory approval  it is a simple  product, but some  products  like drugs and\\nmedicines required regulatory approval. So, that itself could take many months to get.\\nSo, to cut the lead time, this provision enables a company to use a patented invention for\\nthe purposes of developing and submitting information required under any law.

Now there are 2 or rather\\n 768  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 771}), Document(page_content='3 types  of parallel  importation.  There is something  which we call  the international\\nparallel importation when we have the national parallel importation and the regional\\nparallel importation.

So, a sale in a foreign country\\nwill not amount to exhaustion of rights because the sale has not happened within the\\nterritory the first sale has not happened within the territory.\\nSo, there is you will find some information on these how these standards operate, but for\\nthe purpose of the Indian act we have what is called an international standard of parallel\\nimportation which means that any person if you buy from any person who is duly\\nauthorized by the law in which he operates to produce and sell or distribute a product\\nthen that will allow you to import the product into India. Now we saw that defenses that\\na person can raise and the defenses as we mentioned can be broadly summarized into 3\\none a defense of non infringement 2 a defense of invalidity 107A and the statutory\\ndefenses 107(2) and 10 A, these are all the statutory defenses because these defenses are\\ncreated by the statute the patents act the patents act created these defenses.\\n 769  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 772}), Document(page_content='Patent Law for Engineers and Scientists\\nProf. Feroz Ali\\nDepartment of Management\\nIndian Institute of Technology, Madras\\nLecture – 71\\nPatent Enforcement, International Arrangements & Other Miscellaneous\\nProvisions\\nReliefs in Suit for Infringement\\nKeywords:  Injunction/Relief/Damages/accounts  of  profit/\\nPlaintiff/Defendant/Proforma/Infringement\\nNow, what could be the reliefs a patentee claims in a suit for infringement, now let us\\nlook at the reliefs. Broadly the patentee can asked for two broad reliefs; one in any suit\\nfor infringement, the patentee can seek an injunction and injunction is subject to terms\\nand conditions. In injunction is the reliefs of stopping the other person from doing the\\nactivity, and injunction when you say you have an injunction against the person then the\\ninjunction would require that person to specifically if it pertains to patents for him to stop\\nfrom  doing things. If he  is  manufacturing  the  patented  article  he has  to  stop from\\nmanufacturing at. If he selling it he has to stop from selling it, if he is using it he has to\\nstop from using it.\\nSo, based on the language of section 48 and injunction would mean depending on the\\nwording of the injunction, would mean it would stop the person from doing that activity.\\nSo, the first one of the reliefs that a person can claim in an infringement suit is injunction\\n 770  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 773}), Document(page_content='stopping the defendant from doing the activity and in addition at the option of the\\nplaintiff by plaintiff we mean, the patentee the patent holder or the person who drives a\\ntitle from the patent holder or at the option of the plaintiff. The plaintiff is the person\\nwho files the case, the person who initiates the case, the person who makes the complaint\\nis called the plaintiff and he seeks a relief.\\nSo, what are the reliefs you can seek he can ask the court to stop the person from doing\\nthe infringing activity, which is what we call injunction or at the option of the plaintiff he\\ncan either ask for damages or an account of profits. Now damages means compensation\\nyou can ask for compensation because his invention was used without his permission.\\nSo, you can ask for monetary compensation or account of profits. He can ask for the\\naccount of profits asks the person to keep give accounts of the profits he made and then\\ndetermine by a further procedure as to what he is entitled to from that profit because\\nmany a times the profit fully may not be something which the patentee can claim.\\nSo, broadly the reliefs are stopping the person from doing a particular act and claiming\\nmonetary compensation. 2 states 108(2) talks about certain for the other reliefs. The\\ncourt may also order that a good which are found to be infringing and material, and\\nmaterials  and  implement  the  predominant  use  of  which  is  in  the  creation  of  the\\ninstrument goods shall be seized, forfeited or destroyed as the code deems fit under the\\ncircumstances of the case without payment of any compensation. Now this is the relief of\\nsee seizure, forfeiture and destruction. So, not only there is the court can stop a person\\nfrom doing things, if he has already manufactured a good amount of infringing material,\\nthe court can also order seizure, forfeiture and destruction.\\nSo, this power is also given. So, in cases where an infringement, infringer is involves in\\npiracy or involves in creating duplicate copies of the patented product, then this option is\\nopen that not only can a patentee stop him from doing things, the patentee can also seize\\nall the existing particles infringing articles and destroy them. Now, 109 tells us about the\\nright of an exclusive licensee, now the exclusive licensee in many ways acts like the\\npatentee. Now if we need to understand what an exclusive licensee we can do we need to\\ngo back to section 2 the definition of exclusive licensee, in section 2(1)(f) exclusive\\nlicensee  means  a licence  from a patentee,  which confers on the licensee  or on the\\nlicensee  and  the  persons  authorized  by  him.  To the  exclusion  of  all  other  persons\\n 771  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 774}), Document(page_content='including  the  patentee  this  is  important  when  an  exclusive  licence  is  granted,  the\\nexclusive licensee can even exclude the patentee the act says that.\\nIncluding  the  patentee  any right in  respect of the  patented  invention  and exclusive\\nlicensee shall be construed accordingly. So, the holder of an exclusive licensee can even\\nexclude the patentee. Now the question arises if the holder of a exclusive licensee can\\nexclude  the  patentee,  who will  take  action  if there  is  an infringement?  This  is  the\\nlegitimate  question that can arise because the exclusive licensee can even keep the\\npatentee away from enforcing its right his right. So, the exclusion is complete in the\\nsense that even the patentee who was granted the licence cannot do anything pertained\\ninto a patent. So, what happens if the patent is given on an exclusive licence and there is\\ninfringement? Going by the definition the patentees cannot take action unless the parties\\nof agreed to the contrary, going by the definition the patentee cannot take action.\\nSo, the law should empower an exclusive licensee to take action of on infringement that\\nyou find in 109. See, normally we understand the rights of a patentee under section 48 as\\nincluding  the  rights  of  a  person  whose  holder  of  the  patent.  Now  109  allows  the\\nexclusive licensee to act like a patentee, 109(1) the holder of an exclusive licensee shall\\nhave the like right as a patentee to institute a suit in respect of any infringement of a\\npatent after the date of the license, and in avoiding damages or an account of profit or\\ngranting any other relief in any such suit the court shall take into consideration the lost\\nsuffered or likely to be suffered by the exclusive licensee as such or as the case may be\\nthe  profits  carried  by  means  of  infringements.  So,  for  it  will  constitution  and\\ninfringement of rights of the exclusive licensee as such.\\nSo, the exclusive licensee here is empowered to take an action of infringement and also\\nseek damages or account of profit and in granting damages the court shall consider the\\nloss suffered by the exclusive licensee. So, if the exclusive licensee it took a particular\\nlicense, and pursuant to that there was infringement and he suffered a loss then they can\\nclaim infringement. Apart from stopping the person from infringing they can also claim\\nthe reliefs to come back to them. Now 109(2) states that in any suit for infringement of a\\npatent by a holder of an exclusive licensee under subsection 1, the patentee shall unless\\nhe as joined as a plaintiff in the suit be added as a defendant, but a patentee so, added as\\na defendant shall not be liable for any cause unless he enters and appearance and takes\\npart in the proceedings.\\n 772  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 775}), Document(page_content='Now, we saw that an exclusive licensee can operate without the patentee that is the\\ndefinition. We also I have seen that an exclusive licensee can file a suit on its own. Now\\nthis provision says that the patentee shall be added as a defendant. So, if there is some\\ninformation with regard to the patent which only the patentee can give for that purpose\\nhe can be added as a defendant, but they cannot be any claim now the patentee can be\\nadded as defendant if he is not already shown as a plaintiff. Sometimes the exclusive\\nlicensee and the patentee will file a joint suit they will be shown as join plaintiffs.\\nPlaintiff number one will be the exclusive licensee or the patentee and the other person\\nwe will be shown as plaintiff number 2.

A person who has\\ntaken a license under section 84. a compulsory licensee is also empowered with some\\nrights to institute a suit for infringement.\\nNow, in 109 we saw that an exclusive licensee and exclusive licensee fill in all cases be a\\nperson who has voluntary taken a license, but 110 talks about a compulsory licensee a\\nperson  who  holds  a  compulsory  license  under  84,  also  has  the  right  to  initiate\\ninfringement proceedings. Any person to whom a license has been granted under section\\n84  shall  be  entitled  to  call  upon  the  patentee  to  take  proceedings  to  prevent  any\\ninfringement of a patent, and if the patentee refuses or neglects  to do so, within 2\\nmonths, after being so called upon, the licensee may initiate institute proceedings for\\ninfringement in his own name as though he were the patentee, making the patentee a\\ndefendant, but the patentee. So, added by the defendant shall not be liable for any cost\\nunless he enters appearance and takes part in the preceding.\\nNow, in this case the procedures slightly different, in the case of an exclusive licensee he\\ncould show the patentee as a join plaintiff he could show as a co plaintiff. Now that\\noption is not here and the exclusive licensee since he can operate to the exclusion of the\\npatentee,  he  could  file  the  patent  infringement  suit  without  seeking  any  bodies\\npermission  or  without  informing  anyone.  Here  that  is  not  the  case  because  the\\ncompulsory licensee has a limited license, and that is given by the patent office. So, if he\\ndetects infringement the compulsory licensee should inform the patentee and ask him to\\ntake action against the infringement, and if the patentee does not do anything for 2\\nmonths then he can file a case by in his own name and even then he can show the\\npatentee only as a defendant. If somebody ask the question though in the following cases\\nthe patentee shall help can be shown as a plaintiff. A and exclusives and licensee files a\\ncase for infringement and shows the patentee as the plaintiff, b and compulsory licensing\\nfiles  a case for infringement and shows the patentee  as the plaintiff and two other\\nchoices, and if you were to pick up the true statement the statements will be what comes\\nunder section 109, because in 110 the compulsory licensee cannot show the patentee as a\\nplaintiff.\\nSo, that is difference  between these two provisions, the other part of the provision\\nremains the same the patentee who is added as the party if he does not appear he is not\\nliable for costs.

Now this is called the defense of\\ninnocent infringement. The defendant did not know that the patent existed and one of the\\nconditions required here is the moment he came to know he stopped the infringing\\nactivity, to demonstrate is good will. \\n(Refer Slide Time: 14:41)\\nExplanation, a person shall not be deemed to have been aware or to have at reasonable\\ngrounds for believing that a pattern, that a patent exist by reason only of the application\\nto the article of the word patent, patented or any word or words expressing or implying\\nthat  a  person  has  been  obtained  for  the  article,  unless  the  number  of  the  patent\\naccompanies the word or words in question.\\nSo, this is something which patentees have to take care in practice, it is not just sufficient\\nthat they say patented or patented article, they also have to give the number of their\\npatent.  It  is  normally  I  and  followed  by  another  long  string  of  numbers.  So,  it  is\\n 775  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 778}), Document(page_content='necessary to show that the patent is identified by number, rather than just saying patent\\nor patented. So, if the patent is identified by number that serves as notice mere use of the\\nword patent or patented in itself will not amount to notice. Subsection 2, in any suit for\\ninfringement of a patent the court may if it things fit, refuse to grant any damages or\\naccount of profit in respect of any infringement committed, after a failure to pay any\\nrenewal fee within the prescribed period or before the extension of that period.\\nNow, we had already seen that the patent can only be enforced, during the time when the\\nrenewal fee is being paid. So, if the renewal fee is not paid and the patent is in the lapsed\\ncondition that it is deem to have seized to have effect. Now during that time when the\\nrenewal fee is not paid a patentee cannot claim damages or account of profit. 3) where\\nany amendment to the specification by way of disclaimer correction or explanation has\\nbeen allowed under this act after the publication of the specification, no damages or\\naccount of profits shall be granted in any proceeding in respect of use of the invention\\nbefore the date of the decision allowing the amendment, unless the court is satisfed that\\nthe specification as originally published was framed in good faith, and with reasonable\\nskill and knowledge.\\nNow, if there is a patent and the patent gets amended, then there cannot be damages for\\nacts  that happened for use of the invention  before the date of the amendment.  So,\\nbecause patent rights have to be specific and they have to be clear. So, if you file a case\\nfor infringement, and later on if you amend the claim then the amended claim we will not\\nchange the scope of the protection. So, if the scope of the protection changes, then you\\ncannot go back and stop a person who had committed an infringing act, if the use of the\\ninvention  before  the  date  of  the  amendment,  did  not  fall  within  the  scope  of  the\\namendment. Now there are cases where the court if it is satisfied that the specification as\\noriginally published was framed in good faith, then the court may accommodate, but\\nnormally a patent cannot be enforced after an amendment, for an act that was done\\npertaining to an invention as it was covered before the amendment.\\nSo, if you change the claim you can only stop people after the claim is established all the\\nacts that happen before the claim was amended, you cannot claim damages over it. 4)\\nnothing in the section shall effect the power of the court to grant an injunction in any suit\\nfor infringement of a patent, which simply means that the relief of injunction is not tied\\nto the relief of damages. So, this provision makes it very clear that the ability of a person\\n 776  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 779}), Document(page_content='to stop a person from doing things, is not tied to the persons success in getting damages.\\nSo, even if he had not mentioned the patent number on his invention that will lonely\\njeopardizes ability to seek damages, but that will not affect a person to get an injunction. \\n(Refer Slide Time: 19:01)\\nNow 114 deals with the relief for infringement for partially valid specification; now,\\nwhat happens when a patent is challenged, and some claims of the patent are revoked\\nand the remaining are held to be a valid and infringed. So, how does the court mould the\\nreliefs because if they way 10 claims and 5 claims are let’s assume all of them are\\nindependent claims, 5 claims are held to be invalid or a combination of 5 claims are held\\nto be invalid, and the remaining 5 have been held to be valid and infringing. Now how\\ndoes the court mould its relief? 141 states that if the proceedings for infringement of a\\npatent it is found that any claim of a specification, being a claim in respect of which\\ninfringement is alleged is valid, but any other claim is invalid the court may grand relief\\nand respect of any valid claim which is infringed.\\nNow, this brings out of fundamental principle in patent law, that only a valid claim can\\nbe  infringed.

Now the infringement suit is filed by the patentee to\\nenforce his patent, law provides for certain declaratory reliefs or declaratory suits where\\na person who apprehends an infringement action which means the person who could be\\nthe potential defendant or the potential infringer in an infringement suit to proactively\\napproach the court and get some reliefs from the court.\\nSo, we call them pro-competitive provisions of the patents act; the patents act promotes\\ncomputation at the same time the patents act also grants a monopoly to the patentee in\\nsuch a way that the patentee can guard his rights, but there could be instances where in\\nthe process of enforcing his rights, the patentee could lead to certain abuses those abuses\\ncould  pertain  to  abuse  of use of  a  patent  or  it  could  also  be  abuses  pertaining  to\\ncompetition loss. So, 105 talks about a preventive action, a potential infringer can take\\neven before the infringement suit is filed against him. Now what is that relief, in 105 the\\npotential infringer can approach the court and make a declaration or seek a declaration\\nthat the process that he is using does not constitute infringement.\\nSo, it is a declaration of non infringement. So, we are already mentioned the defendant in\\nan infringement suit can claim the defense of non infringement. So, the defense of non\\ninfringement is just defense person alleges infringement and you state that I am not\\ninfringing; what I am doing is different or the patents scope of the patent does not cover\\nthe activity. I am doing maybe a product that I am manufacturing or a process I am using\\nthe scope of the patent or the boundaries of the patent does not cover my activity this is\\nthe defense of non infringement, a declaration of non infringement is where you ask the\\ncourt to give grant your relief in a defense you are not actually asking for relief you are\\nonly asking the court not to grand the relief of infringement there is an infringement that\\nis alleged you just site that as a defense you say that what you are doing is non infringing\\nyou don’t ask the court to give or to declare that your process is non infringing you don’t\\ndo that you just defend yourselves by saying that your process is different.\\nBut in 105, you are entitled to get a declaration by say requiring that the process used by\\nthe  person  or  the  making  use  or  sale  of  any  article  by  him  does  not  constitute\\ninfringement of a claim of a patent against the patentee. Now to do this the patentee\\nshould be first approached by the defendant by way of a writing and you can see in\\nsection  105(1), there  is  2 requirements  a  and b the plaintiff which is  the  potential\\ninfringer the plaintiff has applied in writing to the patentee or exclusive license for a\\n 781  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 784}), Document(page_content='return acknowledgement to the effect that the declaration claimed and as furnished as to\\nhim with full particulars in writing of the process or article in question.\\nSo, before approaching the court it is a pre-requirement that the potential infringer had\\nreturned to the patentee saying that I am adopting a process or I am manufacturing an\\narticle and this process or this article does not infringe your patented process or article.\\nSo, and he should approach the patentee asking for an acknowledgement in writing. So,\\nthe potential infringer writes to the patentee and for a written declaration. So, if the\\npatentee gives the written declaration then they will not be any infringement suit based\\non the action of the potential infringer. So, it is one way to avoid litigation. So, he writes\\nto the patentee and b the patentee or licensee has refused to or neglected to give such an\\nacknowledgement. So, that is the reason why the potential infringer approaches the court\\nhe had ask for an acknowledgement stating disclosing what he is doing and asking the\\npatentee to give a declaration that what is doing is different it is not covered by the patent\\nand hence it is non infringing.\\nThe patentee or the exclusive license refuses to give such a declaration once there is a\\nrefusal then the potential infringer can approach the court within declaratory suit under\\n105. Now there is also a provision under section 34 of the specific relief act where you\\ncould generally get reliefs on declaration, if there is dispute with regard to a pertains\\nmarital status you could there are instances way section 34 has been employed or any\\ndispute with regard to a person’s right or a title it is a very broadly worded provision.

Now this provision is hardly used because once a potential\\ninfringer approaches the court with a proceeding of groundless threat, the court can only\\nissue a declaration if the court finds that the threats are unjustifiable.\\nThe patentee is making threats which are unjustifiable, the easiest thing the patentee can\\ndo is to file an infringement suit because once he files that infringement suit, the threat\\nceases to be a threat, the threat has now manifested into in a form of a proceeding, earlier\\nthe patentee was issuing threats that he will file an infringement suit, but he was not\\ndoing anything, now when the patentee files an infringement suit it ceases to be a threat\\nor rather the threat is not carried out into an action. So, in that case this entire proceeding\\nwill now get converted into an infringement suit. So, this is strategically used sometimes\\npotential infringer wants to move to the court first for whatever advantage they may get\\nby moving to a court first.\\nSo, this is use strategically and this would eventually get converted into a infringement\\nsuit because once the patentee alleges infringement the color of the suit changes and the\\nthen it becomes an infringement suit and the potential infringer can then raise grounds of\\ninvalidity under section 64. So, this could be a way in which to get some kind of a\\ncertainty the potential infringer can approach the court with the declaratory suit, but soon\\nthe patentee will raise issues of infringement and the case would then get converted into\\nan infringement suit. So, it is a strategic tool, it has to be used exercising some caution\\nand there has to be your logic or a strategy behind doing this. Now one another instance\\nwhere these proceedings could be used is to determine the jurisdiction.\\nNow, if the patentee is in one jurisdiction and the defendant or the potential infringer is\\nanother jurisdiction, there is a likelihood that you know a patentee could choose the\\njurisdiction where he wants to approach first, now using 106, the defendant can approach\\nthe court first and request if there is another proceeding filed in an another jurisdiction of\\nequal standing say high court in one state and the high court in the other state, it could\\nrequest the matter to proceed in the court which first looked at the issue there are ways in\\n 786  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 789}), Document(page_content='which these issues can be resolved.

International arrangements refer to the\\nprocess by which you can file multiple patented applications in multiple jurisdictions.\\nNow this is a broad arrangement between various countries that is why we call it an\\ninternational arrangement and there are two types of arrangements we will see that soon\\nThere are two types  of arrangements, wherein you  could file an application in one\\ncountry, regard that as a priority document or that filing based on which you are made\\nthe filing as a priority date, and follow it up with filing in other country. Had it not been\\nfor an international arrangement like this, assume that there was no such international\\narrangement between countries then the only way you can file patent will be to have\\ndifferent teams ready at different patent office around the world, and to file the patent on\\nthe same day in such a way that one filing does not amount to disclosure of the novelty\\nin another office.\\n 800  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 803}), Document(page_content='So, the only way you could preserve the priority and the novelty of an invention, is by\\nfiling multiple applications by having teams to do that in different countries. So, the\\ninternational arrangement actually helps us because it dispenses the need to be physically\\npresent with the team in different countries, to make the application at the same time.\\nNow the differences, priority is important to know who has the claim over an invention.\\nNow, assume that you have an invention and you have placed 3 teams in 3 different\\ncountries to file an application, and you do that on a particular day. On the same day in a\\nfourth country which you have not done which you have not covered, there is another\\nperson who files in application for a similar invention very close to yours. Now that\\ncould lead to problems because that person can claim that he had no knowledge of your\\napplication, and he filed it in a same day in a different country. \\nNow, the international arrangement in a way helps us to resolve those issues because if\\nyou file in international application or a basic application as the act calls it, then based on\\nthe basic application you could follow up many applications in different countries and\\nthey will all take the priority from their international application or the date of the basic\\napplication. Now that can broadly be done in two ways, one is to make a convention\\napplication and the other is to make up PCT patent cooperation treaty. \\nNow, you will remember in form 1 when we talk you through form 1 there was a column\\nin  forma  one  which  dealt  with  types  of  application.  You could  file  in  an ordinary\\napplication that’s an application focused on India an Indian application, you could file a\\nconvention application and the third type was a PCT national phase application. The\\nthree types of applications you can file in India are ordinary convention and a PCT\\nnational phase.\\nNow, conventional a PCT national phase are covered in this chapter. Now the details of a\\nPCT you may not find it here because PCT is a separate treaty in itself to the patent\\ncooperation  treaty  which  is  administered  by  the  WIPO  world  intellectual  property\\norganisation. So, they have dedicated websites, they have dedicated regulations. So, the\\ndetails you have to refer to those regulations to understand how the PCT process works.\\nBut the act covers what you need to know about international arrangements, and this will\\nbe important from the perspective of taking examinations what will be asked is what is\\nbeen covered in the act and rules.

So,  you  could  file  an  application  in  India  and  you  could  get  Indian\\ninternational search report, and then Indian international preliminary examination report.\\nSo, 2013 the amendment carried out in the patent rules that is from rule 19, the rule 19\\nwhich has rule 19, rule 19(a) up until rule 19(n), all these rules were introduced to bring\\nin the details of that are provided under the patent cooperation treaty, by which India\\nbecame an international search authority and an international preliminary examination\\nauthority. \\nAnd  you  will  recollect  that  choosing  India  as  an  international  search  authority  or\\ninternational preliminary examination authority is one of the ways by which you can\\nhave an expedited examination.

Any  country  which  is  a\\nsignatory or a party or a group of country union of countries  or intergovernmental\\norganisations, which are signatories of parties to an international regional bilateral treaty\\nconvention or arrangement to which India is also a signatory or a party. So, it could be\\nanything, it could be a treaty a bilateral treaty, a convention, an arrangement or a regional\\narrangement on international arrangement the requirement is India should be a party to\\nthat.\\n 802  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 805}), Document(page_content='(Refer Slide Time: 07:48)\\nSo, we understand a convention country as any arrangements to which India has is a\\nparty India is a signatory or a party, and which affords to applicants for patents in India\\nor to citizens of India similar privileges as a granted to their own citizens or citizens or\\ntheir member countries in respect of grant of patents and protection of patent rights shall\\nbe a convention country.\\nNow, which means India should be the first requirement is India should be a signatory or\\na party to that arrangement or that agreement or that treaty and that arrangement or treaty\\nor convention should offer reciprocity, meaning which the rights that are offered to\\nIndian citizens India will offer to the citizens of that country, which means the country is\\nrespect each other’s rights\\nSo, on the basis of reciprocity, India can be regarded as a convention country, if India is a\\nsignatory or a party to convention and the convention treats Indians like how it treats its\\nown citizens. So, this is the test for a convention country.

Now in section 6 we saw that an\\napplication can be made by three people or three categories of persons. A True and first\\ninventor, assignee and a legal representative of a person who is entitled to apply these are\\nthe three categories.\\nNow, without prejudice to that, a person who has made an application in a convention\\ncountry and that is the first application he makes in a convention country. There is a\\nconvention in which many say we can take the Paris convention, where many countries\\nare parties to it. So, a person makes an application for the first time in one country say he\\nmakes an application in the United Kingdom.

An application has to be\\nmade  in  a  convention  country,  within  12  months  of  making  that  application,  that\\napplication because it is the first application it will be called the basic application within\\n12 months of the basic application, an application had to be made in India. The priority\\ndate  of the  claim  of the complete  specification  being a claim  based  on the matter\\ndisclosed in the basic application is the date of making the basic application. Which\\nmeans the priority date is the date on which the first application was filed. It is the\\nlogical arrangement, the first date on which the application was file will be the date of\\nthe basic application, because that was the first application that was filed, but it could be\\nfiled in a different country.\\nSo, this we saw in the case of provisional and complete specification; the complete\\nspecification could take in some instances it could take the priority from the provisional.\\nWhat was the requirement? The matter should have been fairly based on the provisional,\\nif the claims are fairly based on the provisional, the claims can take the priority from the\\nprovisional. Now the claims based on matter disclosed is a language used here, you can\\nsee here claims based on matter disclosed in the basic applications this is nothing, but the\\nconcept of fair bases. Matter disclosed is it based the word fairly is missing, but it is\\nunderstood as the same thing.\\nSo, just how we had a fair basis for claims in the complete specification, if they had been\\nfairly based on the disclosure made in the provisional you could claim the priority of the\\nprovisional. Similarly when you file an application in India and the claims or the claim is\\nbased on a matter that was disclosed in a basic application, which as we had mentioned\\nin our example is an application filed in United Kingdom. So, you could claim the\\npriority of the application in United Kingdom. The only requirement is you should file\\nthe Indian application within 12 months of filing the application in the United Kingdom,\\nwhich is what the act refers to as the basic application. \\nSo, the concept of priority when it comes to a convention application is similar to the\\nconcept  of  how  a  complete  specification  takes  its  priority  from  a  provisional\\n 805  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 808}), Document(page_content='specification. But there are some differences here, because in this case both are complete\\nthe basic application is a complete filed in united kingdom, and the Indian application\\nfiled later on within 12 month is also a complete. So, this is complete taking priority\\nfrom another complete and we had also seen in similar instances within the Indian\\npatents act.\\nSo,  this  arrangement  allows  the  international  arrangement  by  filing  a  convention\\napplication, allows you to take priority from another application filed in another country.\\nProvisional and complete pertain to applications filed within India within the Indian\\npatent office, but here by this arrangement you are allowed to take priority from a\\ndifferent application filed in a different country. \\nAnd you have similar provisions like in respect of an invention two or more convention\\ncountries, the period of 12 months shall be reacon from the earliest application.\\n(Refer Slide Time: 14:33)\\njust how we had if there are multiple provisional applications followed by a complete,\\nthen the date the 12 month period will accrue from the date of the first filing the from the\\ndate of the first provisional file. (2)  talks about cognate applications, applications which\\nare related the priority will be from the earliest date. \\nNow, (3)  you  will  find  introduces  PCT  into  the  scheme;  now  this  was  an  earlier\\nprovision.\\n 806  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 809}), Document(page_content='(Refer Slide Time: 15:07)\\nNow, in which only pertain to convention countries and three was inserted in 2005,\\nbecause India became a party to the PCT at a later stage.

There are many instances where a patent\\nis file, the patent office may reject it or the patent is file and you decide down the line\\nthat there is no need to even file a request for a publication, and after 18 months period\\nwhen it gets published, the person who files a patent losses interest in that technology\\nand he may not even file a request for examination.\\nSo, it may get abandoned or it may get abandoned due to certain procedural access an\\nFER  is  filed,  a  reply  is  not  given  within  the  stipulated  time.  So,  there  are  many\\nconditions which could come into play for an application not materializing into a grant.\\nSo, the fee is payable or becomes payable, the renewal fee become payable only at the\\npoint of grant, but the life of a patent start from the date of filing the application.\\n 828  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 831}), Document(page_content='So, there is an anomaly between the day on which the life of a patent starts, and the day\\non which the fee can be collected on a granted patent. So, the fee is always collected\\nafter the grant, but will cover the years that have preceeded in the process of grant. So,\\nnow, when you read (4) you will find that, were a principal patent is granted later than 2\\nyears from the date of filing. After 2 years of filing the fee which have become due in the\\nmeantime, maybe paid with a term of 3 months from the date of recording the patent in\\nthe register which means three months from the date of grant, you have to pay the fee\\nthat becomes due. So, you actually go back in time. So, if the patent is the prosecution of\\npatent goes on for say 5 years or 7 years, then you will have to go back in time and pay\\nthe fee for from the date of the application because the patent right is for 20 years from\\nthe date of application.\\nSo, this provision you can take some instances, you can look at a granted patent in the\\npatent office go to the information on the granted patent, you can actually see the table\\non which the fees have been paid. For every application the patent office has a table\\nshowing when the fee has been paid and when it is due. So, you will find the first\\npayment or comes after the grand, but it also covers the time period before the grant\\nwhen the patent was in prosecution.\\nSo, (4) actually describes a case where the patent office can collect fees after the grant,\\nbut pertaining to years that were before the grant. The time between or let us put it this\\nway the time between the date of filing of application and date of grant, the patent office\\nhas the right to collect the fees even for that period.\\nAs I explained this is being done because the number of applications filed and the\\nnumber of grants are very different, not every application filed materialises into a grant.\\nSo, that is why the system structure not only in India even abroad, based on paying the\\nback fees after a patent is granted.\\n 829  ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/Patent.pdf', 'page': 832}), Document(page_content='(Refer Slide Time: 05:42)\\nNow, fee is decided or stipulated in schedule one of the patent rules. Now you can see\\nthere are at least 2 broad categories of fees, there is e-filing fee which is cheaper we can\\nsee that and there is a physical filing fee. Now there is a tremendous focus on e filing.\\nSo, e-filing is the most preferred way and probably to incentivize e-filing there is a small\\ndifference in the fee for e-filing. So, these are the two broad categories.\\nSo, if you do e filing you follow a particular fee structure, and if you do a physical filing\\nyou follow a different fee structure. Now there are three categories under each of these\\ntwo broad types. In e-filing there are three categories, three different fee structures, and\\nsame for physical file. Now for e-filing you could either be a natural person or a startup;\\nthen your fee is going to be in a particular level or that’s first category.\\nThe second category you could be a small entity along with the natural person or a\\nstartup. So, if you are a small entity, small entity is defined or you are a small entity\\nacting with natural person or a startup you have a the second layer or the second type of\\nfees, then the third type of fee accrues on a person who does not fall into the first to\\ncategory is not an natural person or a startup nor a small entity, then all body corporate\\ncompanies organisations fall into this category.
